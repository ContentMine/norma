				<p>Background ABT-494 is a potent and selective Janus kinase (JAK) 1 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of several autoimmune disorders, with potential for an improved safety profile compared with non-selective JAK inhibitors. This work characterized the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of ABT-494 following single and multiple dosing of the immediate-release formulation. Methods ABT-494 single (1-48 mg or placebo; n = 56) and multiple (3-24 mg or placebo twice daily for 14 days; n = 44) doses in healthy subjects, as well as multiple doses (3-24 mg or placebo twice daily for 27 days; n = 14) in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on a background of methotrexate were evaluated. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected and safety and tolerability were assessed. Results ABT-494 followed bi-exponential disposition, with a terminal elimination half-life of 6-16 h and a functional half-life, calculated from maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) to trough plasma concentration (C trough) ratio at steady state, of 3-4 h. ABT-494 exposure was approximately dose proportional over the 3-36 mg dose range, with no significant accumulation with repeated dosing. In subjects with RA, no pharmacokinetic interaction between ABT-494 and methotrexate was observed. The fraction of ABT-494 dose eliminated in urine as unchanged ABT-494 was 14-25 %. All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate in severity, with headache being the most frequently observed TEAE (15.6 % for ABT-494 vs. 16.7 % for placebo) after multiple twice-daily administration to healthy subjects. No clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs, or electrocardiogram findings in healthy or RA subjects were observed. Conclusions The favorable pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability results from these studies supported further evaluations of ABT-494 in phase IIb dose-ranging trials in RA and Crohn&apos;s disease. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials. gov/) identifier: NCT01741493. Key Points ABT-494, a selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, was safe and well-tolerated at single oral doses up to 48 mg in healthy volunteers and at twice-daily doses up to 24 mg in healthy volunteers and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients using the immediate-release formulation. ABT-494 pharmacokinetics is characterized by a short functional half-life, dose-proportional exposures, and lack of significant accumulation with twice-daily dosing; no pharmacokinetic interaction between methotrexate and ABT-494 was observed in subjects with RA. The results presented in this report supported advancing ABT-494 to phase II dose-ranging studies in RA and Crohn&apos;s disease.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflam- matory disease of unknown etiology. The hallmark fea- ture of RA is an inflammatory process manifested by persistent symmetric polyarthritis of synovial joints, which can ultimately lead to bone erosions, deformity, and disability. Despite major progress in the treatment of RA with various current biologic and conventional syn- thetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), a significant proportion of patients still fail to respond to, or show inadequate response to, current treatments, and hence require alternative treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. The Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family of four tyrosine receptor kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2 <ref type="bibr">[Tyk2]</ref>) that play a pivotal role in cytokine receptor signaling. JAK-mediated signaling pathways are impor- tant for normal and pathologic processes of hematopoiesis and immune cell function, including pathogenic mecha- nisms in RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Therefore, JAK inhibitors have the potential to be efficacious in the treatment of RA and several autoimmune disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Tofacitinib is a pan- JAK inhibitor developed for the treatment of RA that potently inhibits JAK1, JAK3 and, to a lesser extent, JAK2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Tofacitinib demonstrated efficacy in subjects with RA; however, safety signals, particularly anemia, neutropenia, and infections associated with tofacitinib limit its wide use <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Anemia and neutropenia are presumably related to JAK2 inhibition, which leads to interference with erythropoietin and other colony-stimu- lating factor signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. More selective JAK inhibitors targeting JAK1, while minimizing inhibi- tion of JAK2, may provide a better safety profile while maintaining efficacy in RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. ABT-494 is a selective JAK1 inhibitor that is under development as an oral dis- ease-modifying drug for the treatment of RA as well as other autoimmune diseases. In cellular and biochemical assays, ABT-494 demonstrated 74-and 58-fold greater selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2 and JAK3, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This improved selectivity for JAK1 has the potential to selectively inhibit cytokine signaling involved in the RA inflammatory pathways (e.g. interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon signaling pathways) while minimizing inhibi- tion of cytokine signaling for physiological functions (e.g. erythropoietin signaling responsible for hematopoiesis and IL-15 signaling responsible for natural killer cell homeostasis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In vitro metabolism studies suggested that ABT-494 is a non-sensitive substrate for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, with a very minor metabolic contribution from CYP2D6 (data on file, AbbVie).</p><p>In two recently completed phase IIb dose-ranging studies in RA, ABT-494 demonstrated robust efficacy and acceptable safety and tolerability profiles in patients who have shown an inadequate response to methotrexate or anti-TNF therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. ABT-494 is currently being evaluated in phase III trials in RA and in a phase IIb trial in Crohn's disease, and additional phase II trials of ABT-494 in other autoimmune disorders are currently planned <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>In this article, we report the results from phase I studies that characterized ABT-494 pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability in healthy subjects and in subjects with RA. Findings from these studies supported the design and dose selection of phase IIb dose-ranging studies in RA and Crohn's disease.</p></div>

Fifty-six subjects in general good health were randomized to receive single doses of ABT-494 immediate-release capsules <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">36</ref>, and 48 mg) or placebo in a 3:1 ratio, with eight subjects in each dose level. Study drug was administered following at least 10 h of fasting. The study was conducted at PPD Development (Austin, TX, USA), and subjects were confined to the study site and supervised for approximately 8 consecutive days. The study protocol and informed consent were approved by the RCRC Institutional Review Board (IRB; Austin, TX, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>ABT-494 displayed favorable safety and tolerability pro- files over single doses up to 48 mg and multiple doses up to 24 mg twice daily for 14 days in healthy subjects, and for 27 days in subjects with RA. ABT-494 demonstrated a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for twice-daily dosing with the immediate-release formulation. No pharmacoki- netic interaction was seen between methotrexate and ABT- 494, and no accumulation of ABT-494 was seen with repeated administration. The results generated in the pre- sent studies supported the design of the recently completed successful phase IIb trials of ABT-494 in subjects with RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and an ongoing phase IIb trial in subjects with Crohn's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.
