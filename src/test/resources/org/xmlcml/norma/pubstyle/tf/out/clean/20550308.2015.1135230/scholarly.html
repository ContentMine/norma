This is due to the effective polymerization, cross-linking, and chelation mechanism of CA, which completely inhibits the precipitation of metal ions as citrates. Further, the generation of gaseous molecules during the drying process expands the polymeric network and caused the formation of porous structure. In other cases, the poor polymerization as well as precipitation of metal carboxylates exhibits the poor expansion of polymeric matrix during the drying process and results in the formation of solid masses.

The second weight loss occurred between 225 and 275 °C with exothermic peak due to combustion. The observed lower heat generation indicates the poor combustion, which caused gradual weight loss up to 420 °C. </p> <p> From Fig. <a href="#F0005">5</a>, the obtained TG/DTA thermogram of polymeric intermediate prepared with TA shows 5% weight loss between 40 and 70 °C with small endothermic peak (in box), which is due to the removal of absorbed moisture. The gradual weight increment up to 225 °C may be due to the trapped oxygen, which is also observed in CA-assisted intermediates. Rise in the temperature caused about 10% weight loss due to the removal of CO<sub>2</sub> gas as mentioned in Equation (2). The sharp exothermic peak at 318 °C with major weight loss (about 35%) is attributed to the decomposition of polymeric intermediate due to the combustion. Further heating to 600 °C caused slight weight loss which may be due to the removal of undecomposed organic residuals existing in the intermediates, and it is also confirmed from FITR results. </p> </div> <div id="S0006" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2"> <h3>Characterization of synthesized LiCoO<sub>2</sub> powders </h3> <p> Figure <a href="#F0006">6</a> shows the FTIR spectra of LiCoO<sub>2</sub> powders synthesized by CA-, PAA-, and TA-assisted combustion process at 450 °C for 12 h.

FTIR, XRD, and SEM results confirmed that the CA-assisted process exhibits better polymerization than others, which caused the formation of porous foam-type intermediate. Thermal analysis of polymeric intermediates indicates that the CA-assisted intermediates exhibit better combustion due to the porosity, which lead to the organic-free LiCoO<sub>2</sub> powders. Among the three different carboxylic acids, CA-assisted process leads to the synthesis of phase pure nanocrystalline LiCoO<sub>2</sub> powders without organic trace and the average crystallite size is found to be 38 nm. TEM analysis reveals that the synthesized nanocrystalline LiCoO<sub>2</sub> particles exist in the size between 30 and 40 nm. </p> </div> <div class="summationHeading clear clearfix"> <div class="sectionHeadingDiv"> <h2 id="_i22">Funding</h2> </div> </div> <div class="summationSection"> <p> This work was supported by the CSIR, AICTE, DST, and DRDO. </p> </div> <div class="back"> <div class="ack"> <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> <p> The authors gratefully acknowledge the funding agencies CSIR, AICTE, DST, and DRDO for their research support and also utilize the various facilities generated from their major research projects.
