									With the demand for maize increasing, production has spread
									into more water limited, semiarid regions. Couple this with the
									increasing nitrogen (N) fertilizer costs and environmental
									concerns and the need for proper management practices has
									increased. A trial was established to evaluate the effects of
									different preplant N fertilizer sources on maize cultivated
									under deficit irrigation or rain-fed conditions on grain yield,
									N use efficiency (NUE), and water use efficiency (WUE). Two
									fertilizer sources, ammonium sulfate (AS) and urea ammonium
									nitrate (UAN), applied at two rates, 90 and 180 kg N ha
									<sup>−1</sup>
									, were evaluated across four site-years. Deficit irrigation
									improved grain yield, WUE, and NUE compared to rain-fed
									conditions. The preplant application of a pure ammoniacal
									source of N fertilizer, such as AS, had a tendency to increase
									grain yields and NUE for rain-fed treatments. Under irrigated
									conditions, the use of UAN as a preplant N fertilizer source
									performed just as well or better at improving grain yield
									compared to AS, as long as the potential N loss mechanisms were
									minimized. Producers applying N preplant as a single
									application should adjust rates based on a reasonable yield
									goal and production practice.

								<h4 id="sec1">1. Introduction</h4>
								<p>
									Over the last two decades, the number of maize hectares planted
									and harvested in the Southern Great Plains of the United States
									has increased. While the number of irrigated hectares has
									remained fairly constant over this time span, the increase in
									rain-fed hectares has more than doubled [
									<a href="#B1">1</a>
									]. This rise in area cultivated to maize is due to increased
									demand for maize for livestock feed exports and maize-based
									ethanol production [
									<a href="#B2">2</a>
									]. With this increased production and an ever-growing concern
									for environmental implications, sustainable production
									practices that maximize the use of resources are being sought.
								</p>
								<p />
								<p />
								<p>
									In some portions of the Southern Great Plains, groundwater is
									available for irrigation of maize production. However, in
									areas, such as the Ogallala Aquifer, the amount of water
									extracted from the aquifer has been much greater than the
									amount recharged leading to drastic declines in the water table
									which can exceed 50 percent of the saturated thickness [
									<a href="#B3">3</a>
									]. One method utilized to better maximize maize grain yield and
									water use efficiency (WUE) has been deficit irrigation. Deficit
									irrigation is a management practice in which irrigation is
									applied below the evapotranspiration (ET) level at critical
									growth stages without significant reduction in grain yields [
									<a href="#B4">4</a>
									]. The most critical growth stage at which moisture stress has
									been observed to be the most yield limiting in maize is the two
									weeks prior and the two weeks following silking [
									<a href="#B5">5</a>
									]. Irrigation during the reproductive stages can still produce
									optimum grain yields and maximize WUE [
									<a href="#B6">6</a>
									,
									<a href="#B7">7</a>
									].
								</p>
								<p>
									The inefficient use of N fertilizer has been one of the major
									focal points for environmental contamination. A considerable
									factor affecting maize grain yield and N use efficiency (NUE)
									is the chemical make-up of the N fertilizer source. The source
									of the N fertilizer can impact the potential rate of loss
									and/or availability of the fertilizer [
									<a href="#B8">8</a>
									]. According to Tsai et al. [
									<a href="#B9">9</a>
									], utilizing ammoniacal-based N fertilizer sources may reduce
									potential losses via leaching and denitrification and may
									extend the availability of N in the soil for plant uptake
									throughout the growing season. Stevenson and Baldwin [
									<a href="#B10">10</a>
									] compared the effects of ammonium nitrate, urea, and anhydrous
									ammonia applied at different times in maize. Regardless of
									application time, anhydrous ammonia yielded 240 to 260 kg ha
									<sup>−1</sup>
									more than both ammonium nitrate and urea. Power et al. [
									<a href="#B11">11</a>
									] evaluated the effects of ammonium sulfate (AS), ammonium
									nitrate, calcium nitrate, and urea on maize grain yield and dry
									matter production. They reported that maize dry matter
									increased significantly with fertilization; however, grain
									yield differences among the different N sources were seldom
									significant. The ammoniacal sources typically displayed
									increased dry matter production with increasing N rates when
									compared to the calcium nitrate treatments while urea
									treatments were less than the other two ammoniacal sources.
									Olson et al. [
									<a href="#B12">12</a>
									] compared anhydrous ammonia to urea ammonium nitrate (UAN)
									that was applied at planting or sidedress. They reported that
									anhydrous ammonia yielded more than the UAN treatment. They
									attributed the decreased yields in the UAN treatments to the
									nitrate component, which has the potential for being lost
									through leaching or denitrification, and the urea component,
									which has greater potential for N losses via ammonia
									volatilization. Freeman et al. [
									<a href="#B8">8</a>
									] investigated the use of urea and anhydrous ammonia applied at
									different times with different soil incorporation procedures.
									They concluded that both grain yield and N uptake were improved
									when the N fertilizer source was urea, but only if the urea was
									applied and incorporated preplant or after harvest when residue
									incorporation is practiced.
								</p>
								<p>
									The NUE and WUE of maize hybrids often coincide with one
									another [
									<a href="#B13">13</a>
									] because of the greater response to N fertilizer with
									increases in added water [
									<a href="#B14">14</a>
									,
									<a href="#B15">15</a>
									]. Because of this relationship, researchers have evaluated the
									effects of N fertilizer practices on WUE. For maize fields to
									be productive and resource-use efficient, numerous researchers
									have proposed a compromise of management practices that
									optimize grain yield and WUE. These practices include only
									applying N when water is adequate [
									<a href="#B15">15</a>
									,
									<a href="#B16">16</a>
									], maintaining proper fertility based on tillage practices [
									<a href="#B16">16</a>
									] and applying proper amounts of irrigation at critical growth
									stages [
									<a href="#B15">15</a>
									,
									<a href="#B18">17</a>
									,
									<a href="#B19">18</a>
									].
								</p>
								<p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the interactive
									effects of two N fertilizer sources (UAN and AS), application
									rate, and deficit irrigation on maize early season vegetative
									growth, grain yield, NUE, and WUE. Our hypotheses for this
									trial are parallel to what previous researchers have documented
									in that the use of irrigation will increase not only the grain
									yield and NUE, but also the WUE. How efficient each fertilizer
									source will be for each system will be determined with the
									premise that the source that is more ammoniacally based will be
									more efficient regardless of system. </p>

									The experiment was conducted at two locations (Stillwater, OK,
									and Lake Carl Blackwell, OK) during the 2012 and 2013 growing
									seasons. Basic early spring preplant soil nutrient testing
									results (0–15 cm) and site soil mapping unit descriptions are
									provided in Table
									<a target="_blank" href="tab1/">1</a>
									. If required, sites were fertilized prior to planting to 100
									percent sufficient levels based on soil test P and K results
									and the fertilizer recommendations described in Zhang and Raun
									[
									<a href="#B20">19</a>
									]. This practice was conducted to ensure that N was the only
									limiting nutrient.

									A split-block experimental design with three replications per
									site-year was employed to evaluate the effects of irrigation
									and N fertilizer source in this experiment. Irrigated or
									rain-fed treatments served as the main plot, while five N
									fertilizer treatments based upon N source and N rate served as
									the subplot. Ammonium sulfate (AS, 21-0-0) and urea ammonium
									nitrate (UAN, 28-0-0) N fertilizer sources were evaluated in
									this experiment. Both fertilizer sources were applied at N
									rates of 90 and 180 kg N ha
									<sup>−1</sup>
									. Fertilizer was broadcast applied and mechanically
									incorporated prior to planting. A complete list of the five N
									fertilizer treatments, which includes an unfertilized check,
									implemented to both irrigated and rain-fed plots, is provided
									in Table
									<a target="_blank" href="tab2/">2</a>
									. To ensure that the added sulfur associated with the AS
									fertilizer would not have an effect on treatments, preplant
									soil samples were analyzed for sulfate-sulfur content (Table
									<a target="_blank" href="tab1/">1</a>
									). The sulfate-sulfur soil test values were above sufficient
									levels described by the regional recommendations of Zhang and
									Raun [

									are known to express improved drought tolerance. Seeding rates
									were based on best agronomic practices for the region. The type
									of irrigation used was surface drip irrigation. Though this is
									not an economically viable option for irrigation in maize
									production, it was used strictly for research purposes. The use
									of drip irrigation allowed for the accurate measurement and
									placement of applied water. Two strips of drip tape were placed
									through each plot between the first and second rows and between
									the third and fourth rows. The amount of irrigation water (mm)
									distributed over each plot was determined by measuring the
									liters of water applied over the given area.

									Potential differences in early vegetative growth/biomass

									vegetative index (NDVI) values collected with a Greenseeker
									(Trimble, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) ground based, optical sensor.
									Sensor readings were collected at the V6, V8, V10, and V12
									growth stages [
									<a href="#B21">24</a>
									] for all site-years.

								<p>
									Grain yield was determined by harvesting the center two rows of
									the four row plots with a Massey Ferguson 8XP self-propelled
									plot combine (Massey Ferguson, Duluth, GA, USA). Plot grain
									yields were adjusted for a standard moisture content of 155 g
									kg
									<sup>−1</sup>
									. Grain subsamples were oven-dried and processed to pass a 140
									mesh screen and were analyzed for total N content using a dry
									combustion analyzer. The NUE was then calculated by employing
									the difference method described by Varvel and Peterson [
									<a href="#B22">25</a>

									The WUE (kg ha

									mm
									<sup>−1</sup>

									season. It was calculated as the ratio of dry grain yield (kg
									ha
									<sup>−1</sup>
									) at 15.5 percent moisture to the seasonal water use expressed
									as ET. The ET was estimated using a modified water balance
									proposed by Heerman [

									where
									<svg:svg>MATH</svg:svg>
									is the change in soil profile (0 to 80 cm) volumetric soil
									water content from planting to harvest,
									<svg:svg>MATH</svg:svg>
									is the rainfall,
									<svg:svg>MATH</svg:svg>
									is the irrigation. It was assumed that water losses due to deep
									percolation or surface runoff were negligible. The
									<svg:svg>MATH</svg:svg>
									was determined by collecting volumetric soil water samples from
									each plot with a 5 cm diameter probe long enough to encompass
									the 80 cm depth. The samples were collected using a hydraulic
									push probe (Giddings Machine Company, Windsor, CO, USA).
									Samples were collected the day prior to preplant fertilizer
									application and the day following grain harvest for each
									location. A moist weight was collected in the field and the
									samples were then oven-dried until no moisture was present in
									the sample. Daily rainfall was measured from the adjacent
									Oklahoma Mesonet [
									<a href="#B24">27</a>
									] climate-monitoring station.
								</p>
								<p>
									To understand the relationship of irrigation water applied to
									the daily potential ET (PET) for the trial area, daily PET
									values were determined. The PET values were derived from the
									American Society of Civil Engineers’ Standardized Reference
									Evapotranspiration Equation described by Walter et al. [
									<a href="#B25">28</a>
									]. Data collected as inputs for the equation to determine PET
									and rainfall were downloaded from the adjacent Oklahoma Mesonet
									[
									<a href="#B24">27</a>
									] climate-monitoring site. The percent of irrigation water
									applied compared to PET losses for each site-year is described
									in Table
									<a target="_blank" href="tab3/">3</a>

								</p>
								<p>Analysis of variance techniques was employed to detect
									significant differences for the main and interactive effects of
									treatments on early vegetative growth (NDVI), grain yield, NUE,
									and WUE. Single degree-of-freedom contrasts were used to
									partition statistical differences in treatment grouping means
									as well as detect any potential linear or quadratic trends
									based upon N fertilizer rate. All site-years were analyzed
									separately and thus the results are reported separately. For
									all analyses, an alpha level of 0.10 was used to determine
									statistical significance. </p>

									Irrigated and rain-fed grain yield values ranged from 6381 to
									12265 kg ha
									<sup>−1</sup>
									and 2565 to 5980 kg ha
									<sup>−1</sup>
									, respectively. Analysis of variance determined the effect of
									irrigation to be significant on grain yield (Table

									). On average, irrigated plots yielded about 4500 kg ha
									<sup>−1</sup>
									more than rain-fed plots (Table
									<a target="_blank" href="tab5/">5</a>
									). The interactive effect of irrigation and fertilizer
									treatment was significant; however, the main effect of
									fertilizer treatment was not significant. Regardless of the
									fertilizer treatments being irrigated or rain-fed, AS
									treatments had numerically higher grain yields compared to the
									UAN treatments. This trend was also true for the rain-fed
									plots, except for the difference that was statistically
									significant (Table
									<a target="_blank" href="tab6/">6</a>

									statistically significant linear increases in grain yield
									(Table
									<a target="_blank" href="tab6/">6</a>

								<p>Deficit irrigation applied in the later vegetative and
									reproductive maize growth stages significantly increased grain
									yield and WUE. These results are what were to be expected. </p>
								<p>
									Irrigation at times that have been deemed critical for optimum
									grain yield [
									<a href="#B5">5</a>
									] has aided in optimizing yield [
									<a href="#B6">6</a>
									,
									<a href="#B7">7</a>
									]. Though it is only statistically significant for one of the
									four site-years, deficit irrigation also increased the NUE of
									the maize crop. Increases in NUE were likely due to greater N
									uptake and grain yield response to N fertilization. These
									results are similar to what has been observed by other
									researchers [
									<a href="#B14">14</a>
									–
									<a href="#B18">17</a>
									].
								</p>
								<p>
									For three of the four site-years, rain-fed treatments had a
									greater yield response and increase in NUE for the AS
									treatments compared to the UAN treatments. This may be because
									of the more expansive root growth in the maize plant’s attempt
									to acquire more soil moisture. The expansive root system would
									then have the ability to take up more of the immobile ammonium
									in the soil. Another desirable trait of ammoniacal N fertilizer
									sources in maize is that maize is able to take up ammonium
									during reproductive growth, whereas nitrate uptake is inhibited
									[
									<a href="#B9">9</a>
									,
									<a href="#B26">29</a>
									]. Urea ammonium nitrate can be an effective N fertilizer
									source if the potential loss mechanisms (leaching,
									volatilization, and denitrification) are minimized [
									<a href="#B12">12</a>
									]. The UAN treatments did outperform the AS treatments for the
									2013 irrigated trials, but not the 2012 irrigated trials. This
									could be due to the fact that both 2013 sites had an above
									average rainfall for the region and, with adequate moisture
									early in the growing season, expansive root systems were not
									developed, which would have reduced ammonium acquisition from
									the soil. At Lake Carl Blackwell in 2013, the numerically lower
									yield response to UAN under irrigated conditions compared to
									the Stillwater site for that year and the lack of a numerical
									response to UAN for the rain-fed site could be due to potential
									N losses from the UAN. This site received the most rainfall of
									any site-year and we observed the topsoil to be saturated for a
									substantial amount of time prior to reproductive growth, thus
									leading to potential N losses via denitrification.
								</p>
								<p>Little to no observable differences or trends in early season
									vegetative growth, as determined by collecting NDVI values,
									were present. However, with differences observed in grain yield
									and NUE between fertilizer treatments, there is the possibility
									that the inorganic N form (nitrate or ammonium) present in the
									soil later in the growing season affected grain yield and NUE.
								</p>
								<p>
									To better optimize grain yield and NUE, the proper N fertilizer
									rate should be applied. The decrease in NUE values when the N
									fertilizer rate was increased from 90 to 180 kg N ha
									<sup>−1</sup>
									is typical for maize production and has been observed by others
									[
									<a href="#B8">8</a>
									,
									<a href="#B27">30</a>
									]. For irrigated treatments, linear relationships with grain
									yield and N fertilizer rate were usually observed for both UAN
									and AS. However, a few of the rain-fed and irrigated site-years
									displayed statistically significant quadratic trends. These
									trends in which there is either a decrease or no increase in
									grain yield with added N above 90 kg N ha
									<sup>−1</sup>
									point towards excess N being applied and producers should
									adjust N application rates accordingly. With just two
									fertilizer rates plus a check treatment being employed,
									accurately determining an agronomic optimum preplant N
									fertilizer rate with the data from this trial would not be
									precise. However, producers should attempt to utilize some
									forms of a grain yield approach in making a preplant only N
									fertilizer rate recommendation or use regional N response
									trials from similar soil types under irrigation or rain-fed
									conditions.
								</p>
								<p>
									Irrigated maize WUE values reportedly range from approximately
									2 to 40 kg ha
									<sup>−1</sup>
									mm
									<sup>−1</sup>
									[
									<a href="#B28">31</a>
									]. Irrigated WUE values observed in this experiment fell within
									this range. Variability in WUE values among treatments and
									growing seasons is to be expected. Zwart and Bastiaanssen [
									<a href="#B28">31</a>
									] reported climate, water management, and soil fertility, all
									of which were evaluated in this trial and have the potential to
									give rise to the variability of WUE in maize. The main and
									interactive effects determined to be significant from the
									analysis of variance and single degree-of-freedom contrast
									results were similar for grain yield and WUE. This likely could
									be due to the manner in which WUE was calculated for this
									experiment, which involves the ratio of grain yield to the
									measured ET. One variable employed for deriving the ET was to
									measure the change in profile soil moisture prior to planting
									and immediately after harvest. Pre- and postharvest soil
									profile samples revealed no differences in the soil profile
									content between treatments (data not reported). The July and
									August months in the Southern Great Plains can be extremely hot
									and dry and likely much of the soil profile moisture was lost
									to evaporation and some transpiration during the grain dry-down
									period after irrigation had ceased. If no differences were
									observed in ET between fertilizer treatments within irrigated
									or rain-fed plots, then one can conclude that the differences
									in WUE would be dictated by the differences in grain yield.

							<h:section title="5. Conclusions" tag="conclusion">
								<h4 id="sec5">5. Conclusions</h4>
								<p>In conclusion, deficit irrigation during late vegetative and
									reproductive growth stages increased grain yield, NUE, and WUE.
									With three of the four rain-fed site-years reporting increases
									in grain yield and NUE, we would recommend that a pure
									ammoniacal N fertilizer source be applied if a preplant only N
									fertilizer application is to be utilized. If irrigation water
									is available, the N source is not as critical. However, the
									producer should be cognizant of the potential N loss mechanisms
									(leaching, volatilization, and denitrification) of N fertilizer
									sources like UAN. Lastly, if producers are going to utilize a
									preplant only fertilizer N application for maize cultivated on
									the Southern Great Plains, they should accordingly adjust N
									fertilizer rates based on a reasonable irrigated or rain-fed
									yield goal or regional N response trials. </p>
