					<title>Background</title>
					<p>
						Previous studies showed an in-depth ecological understanding by
						traditional people of managing natural resources. We studied the
						landscape ethnoecological knowledge (LEEK) of Sz&#x000e9;kelys on
						the basis of 16-19
						<sup>th</sup>
						century village laws. We analyzed the habitat types, ecosystem
						services and sustainable management types on which village laws
						had focused.
					</p>
				</sec>
				<sec>
					<title>Methods</title>
					<p>Sz&#x000e9;kelys had self-governed communities formed mostly of
						&#x0201c;noble peasants&#x0201d;. Land-use was dominated by
						commons and regulated by village laws framed by the whole
						community. Seventy-two archival laws from 52 villages, resulting
						in 898 regulations, were analyzed using the DPSIR framework.
						Explicit and implicit information about the contemporary
						ecological knowledge of Sz&#x000e9;kelys was extracted. We
						distinguished between responses that limited use and supported
						regeneration and those that protected produced/available ecosystem
						services and ensured their fair distribution.</p>
				</sec>
				<sec>
					<title>Results</title>
					<p>Most regulations referred to forests (674), arable lands (562),
						meadows (448) and pastures (134). Sz&#x000e9;kelys regulated the
						proportion of arable land, pasture and forest areas consciously in
						order to maximize long-term exploitation of ecosystem services.
						The inner territory was protected against overuse by relocating
						certain uses to the outer territory. Competition for ecosystem
						services was demonstrated by conflicts of pressure-related (mostly
						personal) and response-related (mostly communal) driving forces.
						Felling of trees (oaks), grazing of forests, meadows and fallows,
						masting, use of wild apple/pear trees and fishing were strictly
						regulated. Cutting of leaf-fodder, grazing of green crops, burning
						of forest litter and the polluting of streams were prohibited.
						Marketing by villagers and inviting outsiders to use the ecosystem
						services were strictly regulated, and mostly prohibited.
						Sz&#x000e9;kelys recognized at least 71 folk habitat types,
						understood ecological regeneration and degradation processes, the
						history of their landscape and the management possibilities of
						ecosystem services. Some aspects of LEEK were so well known within
						Sz&#x000e9;kely communities that they were not made explicit in
						village laws, others remained implicit because they were not
						related to regulations.</p>
				</sec>
				<sec>
					<title>Conclusions</title>
					<p>Based on explicit and implicit information, we argue that
						Sz&#x000e9;kelys possessed detailed knowledge of the local
						ecological system. Moreover the world&#x02019;s first known
						explicit mention of ecosystem services (&#x0201c;Benefits that are
						provided by Nature for free&#x0201d;) originated from this region
						from 1786.</p>

			<title>Background</title>
			<p>
				A large number of in-depth studies show that
				traditional/indigenous/local ecological knowledge can effectively
				help conserve biocultural diversity and heritage (e.g. [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
				&#x02013;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
				]). Many authors, together with the Intergovernmental Panel for
				Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
				], call for greater efforts and new ways to use
				traditional/indigenous/local ecological knowledge in order to
				safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem services at different levels.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is also well established, that besides an in-depth knowledge of
				the local environment, self-governance by local communities is a
				powerful way of maintaining a sustainable, resilient
				social-ecological system (e.g. [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
				&#x02013;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
				]. Ostrom [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
				] lists, among others (such as collective-choice rules, leadership,
				norms and social capital), knowledge of the local social-ecological
				system as vital for a sustainable self-governed system. Researchers
				argue that resource users should share common knowledge of the local
				ecological system, and have an in-depth understanding of the local
				carrying capacity of the resources/ecosystem services [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
				].
			</p>
			<p>
				Together with the study of the way that recent self-governed systems
				functioned, historical studies also enrich our understanding of the
				value of local ecological knowledge in resource management. An
				important institution for the management of local resources and
				ecosystem services in medieval and modern Europe was the village law
				or village by-laws (e.g.
				<italic>England</italic>
				[
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
				],
				<italic>Denmark</italic>
				[
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
				]
				<italic>, Austria</italic>
				[
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
				],
				<italic>Germany</italic>
				[
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
				],
				<italic>Holland</italic>
				[
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
				]). Village laws regulated forest and grassland management,
				especially pasturing and haymaking, the order of cultivation on
				arable fields, the use of common fields, the use of water resources,
				communal self-government, the rights of craftsmen, clothing and
				punishments for stealing and other improper behaviour [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
				&#x02013;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
				]. In Transylvania, as a result of the privileged status of the
				Sz&#x000e9;kely community, village laws were framed by the whole
				Sz&#x000e9;kely village community (free Sz&#x000e9;kely peasants,
				nobles and serfs). As Sz&#x000e9;kely village laws were written by
				locals to manage the local landscapes, they allow us to reconstruct
				the contemporary local ecological knowledge, in particular how
				people understood landscapes, ecological patterns and processes, and
				how they managed their ecosystem services.
			</p>
			<p>
				In our paper, we use the term landscape ethnoecological knowledge
				(LEEK), which is a subset of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK,
				[
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
				]). As defined by Johnson and Hunn [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
				], landscape ethnoecological knowledge focuses on the ecological
				features of a landscape (e.g. ecotopes, habitats and other landscape
				elements), and shows how the living landscape is perceived, named,
				imagined, classified and managed by the people who inhabit it. Of
				the numerous definitions of ecosystem services, the following was
				used in our paper: ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain
				from ecosystems [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
				]. In subsistent-oriented economies, communities depend directly on
				local ecosystems for food, timber, water and other products needed
				for their livelihood [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
				]. We agree with Kumar [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
				] that we should realize (especially in historical investigations)
				that the properties of ecological systems that people regard as
				&#x0201c;useful&#x0201d; may change over time, even if the
				ecological system itself remains relatively constant. Thus, study of
				ecosystem services demands parallel analysis of the environment and
				the socio-economic system.
			</p>
			<p>
				Village laws have usually been published and analysed from
				historical, legal and agricultural viewpoints (e.g. [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
				&#x02013;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
				]) but there is a scarcity of analyses from an ecological point of
				view [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
				]. Dirkx statistically analysed regulations by focusing on forest
				grazing by different livestock and other uses of woodlands and used
				the
				<italic>Marke Boeken</italic>
				to reconstruct the deforestation history of the Dutch landscape [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
				]. Vera, Buissink and Weidema [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
				] used village laws to document medieval woodland structure and
				regeneration, forest grazing and masting. Imreh [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
				] argues that village laws resulted in many cases in the protection
				of the natural environment. Besides these publications, there are a
				large number of studies on the late medieval and modern
				environmental history of Europe. Studies focused on, among others,
				modelling agro-environmental systems [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
				&#x02013;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
				] and analysis of long-term landcover/landuse-changes and their
				driving forces [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
				&#x02013;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
				]. Historical overviews of pre-industrial resource management
				systems are also frequent [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
				&#x02013;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
				]. These and some other results suggest that villagers in medieval
				and modern time Europe had a profound understanding of the ecology
				of the surrounding landscape [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
				]. However, to date, no explicit analysis of their landscape
				ethnoecological knowledge has been undertaken.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main aim of our study was to document how Sz&#x000e9;kely
				village laws regulated the management of the landscape and its
				ecosystem services during the 16-19
				<sup>th</sup>
				centuries. Both region and the chosen time period are also rich in
				quantifiable, comparable and relevant historical data. Our specific
				goal was to reconstruct the landscape ethnoecological knowledge of
				Sz&#x000e9;kely people based on published village laws [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
				]. Our hypothesis was that an in-depth ecological understanding of
				species, habitats, ecological processes and carrying capacity of
				resources was needed in order to sustain a management system that
				lasted for at least 300&#x02009;years.

				<title>Study area</title>
				<p>
					The study area is located in the Sz&#x000e9;kelyf&#x000f6;ld region
					of Transylvania, Romania (12 800&#x02009;km
					<sup>2</sup>
					, coordinates: 45&#x000b0;32&#x02019;- 47&#x000b0;09&#x02019; N;

					<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
					). From the legal historical viewpoint, Sz&#x000e9;kelyf&#x000f6;ld
					is the sum of those areas where Sz&#x000e9;kely (pronounced as Se:
					kei) law was determinative. Like some other mountainous regions of
					Europe (cf. [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
					]), the region formed a relatively stable social-ecological system
					from late medieval times until the Second World War [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
					]. Small-scale, traditional agriculture was retained in many
					places, even during socialism (1945&#x02013;1989).

					The western part of the study area belongs to the
					Erd&#x000e9;lyi-Mez&#x00151;s&#x000e9;g (a highland region,
					300&#x02013;500 metres above sea level, covered by Pannonian and
					Sarmata deposits), the eastern part belongs to the Eastern
					Carpathians (a mountainous area, 700&#x02013;2300 metres above sea
					level with crystalline bedrocks, flysch and neogene volcanic
					surfaces). The two main rivers of the region are the Maros
					(Mure&#x0015f;) and Olt (Olt). Climate is moderately continental
					with short summers and long winters. The annual mean temperature
					ranges from 4 to 7&#x000b0;C, the annual precipitation is
					500&#x02013;700&#x02009;mm in the highland areas and basins and
					1000&#x02013;1200&#x02009;mm in the mountains. Forests still cover
					ca. 35&#x02013;40% of the area. By the 20
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, most oak forests, many beech and some spruce forests had
					been replaced by arable fields, pastures and meadows. The highland
					areas are dominated by
					<italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic>
					,
					<italic>Quercus petraea</italic>
					and
					<italic>Carpinus betulus</italic>
					forests, whereas mountainous areas are covered by
					<italic>Picea abies</italic>
					and
					<italic>Fagus sylvatica. Tilia cordata, Fraxinus excelsior</italic>
					and
					<italic>Acer</italic>
					spp. are also widespread (Figure&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
					). Above ca. 1500&#x02013;1700 metres, subalpine grasslands and
					shrubs are typical. Many grassland types and patches in
					Transylvania are species-rich. Some of the most species-rich dry
					grasslands in the world [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
					] and mountainous hay meadows in Europe (80&#x02013;85 vascular
					species per 16&#x02009;m
					<sup>2</sup>
					; [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
					]) are to be found in the region. The main crops of the region are
					potato and maize. After the building of the railway network in the
					late 19
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, spruce timber became an important export good. The 52
					villages examined, and for which information on village laws was
					available, are scattered throughout the Sz&#x000e9;kelyf&#x000f6;ld
					region.

				<title>The Sz&#x000e9;kely people</title>
				<p>Sz&#x000e9;kelys form a Hungarian ethnic group that has lived in
					this area for at least a millenium. The time period examined in
					this study (1581&#x02013;1847) covers the last two and a half
					centuries of feudalism, namely, the pre-capitalistic period. During
					this period, most Sz&#x000e9;kelys lived in self-governed village
					communities. Villages were composed of three main social classes:
					the upper class with the highest social position comprised the
					highest nobles (called primor), having moderately-sized estates and
					owning land in several different villages. They constituted ca. 3 %
					of Sz&#x000e9;kely society. The second group comprised the lower
					nobles: constituting ca. 50-60% of the population. These had
					&#x0201c;noble peasant&#x0201d; status (not paying tax, having
					rights to elect local village leaders etc.) and served the king as
					soldiers, providing also services (e.g. food and accommodation) for
					the army during periods of both war and peace. They are also called
					the free Sz&#x000e9;kelys. The third major social class was formed
					of outlawed, farming serfs who had to pay taxes.</p>
				<p>
					At the turn of the 15-16
					<sup>th</sup>
					centuries, human population of the Sz&#x000e9;kelyf&#x000f6;ld
					region was ca. 70 000 [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
					], i.e. ca. 5 people/km
					<sup>2</sup>
					, which increased to 15/km
					<sup>2</sup>
					by 1786 and to 24/km
					<sup>2</sup>
					by 1850/1851 [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
					]. In 1651, on average, 51 families lived in a Sz&#x000e9;kely
					village [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
					]. In contrast to Western Europe, the latifundium mainly consisted
					of scattered lands in Sz&#x000e9;kelyf&#x000f6;ld. In most cases,
					the three main social classes shared different proportions of the
					Sz&#x000e9;kely village-territory. A significant part of the
					territory was owned by free Sz&#x000e9;kelys. The structure of the
					society was relatively stable during the 270&#x02009;years examined
					[
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>

					serf, while in 1844/1847, 52% of the population was free
					Sz&#x000e9;kely and 22% was serf [

					].
				</p>
				<p>In the Sz&#x000e9;kely self-government system, the village itself
					elected its own leader, who was himself controlled by the village
					community. The task of the elected leader was the organization of
					the village and its commons (e.g. forest use, grazing, arable
					farming). The leader was required to make the village community
					undertake public work and to keep order and discipline. In a
					Sz&#x000e9;kely village, there was usually constant competition for
					public benefits, legitimacy, material welfare and positions of
					power in society. The village community could possess common estate
					and obtain income, punish collectively, take action or organize
					village meetings.</p>
				<p>
					In Sz&#x000e9;kelyf&#x000f6;ld, personal freedom was generally
					considered of little importance. However collective freedom
					(freedom of the whole village community) was relatively high. The
					state had little direct power over individuals compared with
					neighbouring countries. Village communities were able to buffer
					against the local impacts of regional/national driving forces [

					During the 17-18
					<sup>th</sup>
					centuries, the agricultural techniques of the Sz&#x000e9;kelys were
					similar to those found in many other European countries. Data show
					that the 18
					<sup>th</sup>
					century agricultural revolution of Western Europe had not reached
					the region until the mid 19
					<sup>th</sup>
					century [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. Since there were just a few large seigniorial domains,
					small-scale farming played a significant role in agriculture
					(Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>
					). The nobleman&#x02019;s domain neither became a model nor played
					a significant role in the changing of traditional practices [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. Since Sz&#x000e9;kelys were averse to change, development of
					cultivation techniques was very slow. This is also evidenced by the
					long (often unchanged for over 100&#x02009;years) survival of
					individual village laws [

				<p>
					In the 16
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, hereditary estates began to spread, but even at the end of
					the 18
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, community land ownership of arable fields, hay meadows,
					pastures and forests was common in Sz&#x000e9;kelyf&#x000f6;ld [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. Owners with higher social position and major personal estate
					could possess a larger proportion of common arable field, meadow
					and acorn yield, but had no greater timber rights than others in
					the prohibited forests [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. Lack of timber and firewood occurred in many villages, but the
					distribution of shortage was unequal. According to data from 1808
					for a subregion of Sz&#x000e9;kelyf&#x000f6;ld
					(Udvarhelysz&#x000e9;k), community members were allowed to clear
					forests in 32 villages, clearing was prohibited in 70 villages
					(where forests/wood were in sufficient supply), and there was a
					shortage of satisfactory trees in 26 villages [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>
					During the 19
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, forests and pastures were not separated from each other.
					The border of adjacent villages was also often not strictly
					defined, especially in the more mountainous areas. Until the 19
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, Sz&#x000e9;kelys owned common regions (called
					&#x0201c;havas&#x0201d;, meaning alps, mostly subalpine
					forest-grassland mosaics) on which every settlement could have a
					claim. Production for the markets started mainly in these common
					forests at the end of the 18
					<sup>th</sup>
					century [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>
					Until the late 18
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, the two-field system was dominant in
					Sz&#x000e9;kelyf&#x000f6;ld. In this system, arable and fallow
					fields were rotated annually. Fields of a village were arranged
					into an arable and a fallow block. Fallows were grazed. Owing to
					the extensive hinterland, this form of agriculture was more
					favourable for animal husbandry (mainly cattle, sheep, horse and
					pig) [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. Fodder production on arable land was almost absent.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1870, the proportions of land-use types in K&#x000e1;szon (a
					subregion of Sz&#x000e9;kelyf&#x000f6;ld) was as follows: 41%
					forest, 31% hay meadow, 18% arable land, 8% pasture, 2.5% non-used
					land [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
					]. Forest cover of Sz&#x000e9;kelyf&#x000f6;ld, as estimated by
					Szab&#x000f3; on the basis of the First Military Survey, was
					approx. 47&#x02013;48 % at the end of the 18
					<sup>th</sup>
					century [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>Near the villages, sessile oak forests with hornbeam and beech
					forests dominated. Pastures, fallow land, forests and hay meadows
					were used for grazing. Fences prevented free movement and grazing
					by livestock. Sz&#x000e9;kelys left stubble about a span tall so
					that weeds could regenerate rapidly, resulting in high quality
					pastures. As a result of grazing, fallow lands became manured and
					after 2&#x02013;3 ploughings, weed density had decreased.</p>
				<p>
					Wheat, barley and oats were the main arable crops. Maize and potato
					appeared only at the end of the 18
					<sup>th</sup>
					century [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. There were fruit trees in the gardens and forests, and sometimes
					grape vines were cultivated on warm hillsides. The intensity of
					manuring was much less than it was in Western Europe. On average,
					the Sz&#x000e9;kely household owned ca. 5 livestock units. These
					animals were kept in the stable or barn from December until
					February, and produced only ca. 12&#x02013;13 carts of manure. This
					amount of manure was not sufficient even for 0.5 hectare of arable
					land [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. Rather than cart out manure from the stable, manure production
					by the corralling of sheep overnight predominated. In the second
					half of the 18
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, the frequency of manuring a single parcel of land was
					generally once every 6&#x02013;8 years. During the intervening
					period, the land was left fallow 3&#x02013;4 times. Stable manure
					was only rarely applied to hay meadows [

				<title>Village laws</title>
				<p>
					The first written village laws were produced in Zal&#x000e1;n and
					Gyergy&#x000f3;&#x000fa;jfalu (Z&#x001ce;lan and Suseni) in 1581.
					The last village law was written in 1847. At the time of framing
					these laws, Sz&#x000e9;kelys thought that they had already been in
					force for much longer [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. This means that oral forms (perhaps even written forms) of these
					laws were already common before this time. Some of the
					centuries-old Sz&#x000e9;kely laws survived until present and are
					still used in pasture and forest commons, as in other European
					countries (e.g. Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Scotland, France, Spain,
					the Netherlands) where commons have also survived until present [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
					&#x02013;
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>
					Village laws laid down the will and intention of local community
					members from generation to generation. Village laws were written
					down by local or appointed clerks, but the regulations were framed
					and approved by the whole community. Sz&#x000e9;kelys believed that
					an adequate village law must be both old enough and sufficiently
					projected into the future [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. There was no unified Sz&#x000e9;kely village law; all of them
					were unique, but because of similarities in terms of landscapes,
					societies and economics, they have much in common. Village laws
					were announced from time to time, mainly for the sake of new
					community members [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. In Western Europe, community rule-making and jurisdiction had
					already been suppressed by the 16
					<sup>th</sup>
					century. However Sz&#x000e9;kelys started to commit their ancient
					laws to writing at that time. Sz&#x000e9;kelys often emphasized in
					their laws that the judge could only make decisions &#x0201c;with
					the support of the community&#x0201d;.
				</p>
				<p>A typical Sz&#x000e9;kely village law consisted of 2&#x02013;5
					pages comprising 5&#x02013;20 short or long regulations. In the
					first introductory part, the Sz&#x000e9;kely people stated the
					intention of the law. Here, they usually referred to respect for
					ancestors and inherited responsibility. This part was followed by
					the regulations which referred not only to the use of forests,
					grasslands, arable fields etc. studied in this paper, but to other
					spheres of village life, such as the punishment of criminals,
					obligation of the judge, the order of fire-fighting and postal
					service etc. In the last part, some community members would testify
					about the accuracy of the law and the consensus of the villagers.</p>
				<p>
					It is important to emphasize that the laws of each village were
					based entirely on local, inside knowledge of the communities: they
					were based on former written and oral laws, customs and common laws
					and the perception of changing conditions. There is no evidence
					that the laws were copies or that they were adapted from those of
					other villages. Terms used in village laws testify to their
					independence [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>
					During the Enlightenment, the Habsburg Monarchy deliberately
					reduced village self-government. However, by the second half of the
					18
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, the Monarchy had still not been able to dominate local
					village life. Although state forest law already existed (1781), it
					was only partly effective in this region. By the 19
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, the system of village community had become obsolete and a
					hindrance to the process of modernization. Nevertheless, open-field
					systems could be seen in many places until the commencement of
					World War II.

			<sec id="Sec7">
				<title>Data collection</title>
				<p>
					When collecting data, we used printed publications as sources of
					village laws. These included: &#x0201c;The self-regulating
					Transylvanian village&#x0201d; [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					] and &#x0201c;Order in the Transylvanian village&#x0201d; [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
					]. We examined every village law published in these volumes (52
					Sz&#x000e9;kely villages, 72 village laws). Laws were written
					during the 16-19
					<sup>th</sup>
					century in a form of the Hungarian language that is still
					comprehensible today. We grouped and interpreted regulations
					according to the categories of the DPSIR framework, sorted them
					into a table, and then encoded and aggregated the data.
				</p>
				<p>
					We used the DPSIR framework to understand, analyse and quantify the
					Sz&#x000e9;kely social-ecological system in its complexity. The
					DPSIR framework was developed by the European Environmental Agency
					(EEA) in 1999 in order to be used as a general platform for
					environmental data collection, categorization and dissemination [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
					]. According to B&#x000fc;rgi et al. [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
					], the DPSIR framework is particularly useful for the evaluation of
					planning processes.
				</p>
				<p>
					We paid particular attention to any ecological information that
					emerged either explicitly or implicitly from village laws and to
					the tacit traditional ecological knowledge. We collected the local
					folk names of every animal and plant species, the categories of
					folk habitats, habitat mosaics, types of forest and grassland uses
					and we analyzed the ecological context of the regulations. The
					latter was supported by our botanical and ethnoecological studies
					that have been conducted in this region since 2000 [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>
					Since it was the contemporary landscape ethnoecological knowledge
					that formed the focus of our attention, we did not reconstruct the
					actual monetary value of the punishments that were meted out (e.g.
					Florints, Florenis, Flor., Denars). The value of the currency might
					have also changed throughout the 17-18
					<sup>th</sup>
					centuries [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					].

				<title>Data analysis</title>
				<p>
					The DPSIR concept has been widely used for documenting and
					understanding environmental problems and developing preservation
					strategies [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
					], and rarely for analyzing historical landscape management systems
					[
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
					]. Driving forces in the DPSIR framework are forces that elicit and
					define those human activities that relate to the use of landscapes
					and ecosystem services. The main driving forces can be
					socio-economic, political, technological, natural and cultural [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
					], and can be global, regional or local in scale. In our study, we
					paid particular attention to the local social demands (see also [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
					]). Driving forces result in different pressures. Our study focuses
					on pressures relating to human activities, such as clearing and
					management of forests, use of pastures and hay meadows, arable
					lands and water, in general the use of ecosystem services. The
					state of the natural environment may change in response to
					pressures. Species composition, dominant species, tree age and
					density, nutritional value of the grass cover and soil fertility
					all reflect the quality of ecosystems. Impact is usually perceived
					as a reduction or a shortage of ecosystem services (e.g. less
					timber) caused by changes to the environment. This encourages the
					community to respond. These responses are intended to solve
					reductions and shortages caused by pressure-induced changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the appropriate use of the DPSIR framework, it was essential to
					understand the meaning behind certain passages thoroughly. Hence
					for the analysis, we used the footnotes and writings of Imreh and
					other contemporary source publications (eg. statistics, litigious
					cases, village community decrees, decisions and resolutions; [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
					&#x02013;
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
					]).
				</p>
				<p>
					We quantified not only driving forces relating to pressures, but
					also driving forces relating to responses. While the former is
					defined as the demand of the active executor of a certain pressure
					action (e.g. cutting of a tree for personal use), the latter is
					defined as the demand of the community (e.g. preserving large
					enough tracts of forests for future use by the community). This is
					not about driving forces on a personal and community scale (cf. [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
					]), rather the judgement of a certain action can differ for each of
					the two social scales. As the statements were often partly implicit
					owing to the concise framing of village laws, we reconstructed both
					implicit and explicit driving forces.
				</p>
				<p>We divided the responses into two main groups: (1) responses
					limiting the use and supporting the regeneration of ecosystem
					services; and (2) responses that protect produced/available
					ecosystem services from theft and destruction, thus ensuring their
					fair distribution among community members.</p>
				<p>As well as presenting a quantitative analysis of our database, we
					show the style and ecological content of village laws, together
					with original quotations.</p>
				<p>Finally, we reconstructed all types of landscape ethnoecological
					knowledge that appeared either explicitly or implicitly in
					Sz&#x000e9;kely village laws according to DPSIR categories.
					Knowledge related to obtaining and managing ecosystem services was
					considered to be Pressure-related knowledge. Knowledge related to
					the perceived usefulness of ecosystems was considered to be
					Impact-related knowledge, that is, knowledge resulting from
					State-related knowledge and monitoring, which helps in recognizing
					actual or potential changes in the condition of resources. Indeed,
					for appropriate interpretation of impacts, it was necessary for
					villagers to recognize what the exploitable ecosystem services
					actually were and which ecosystem services or functions had
					diminished or were about to diminish.</p>
				<p>Response-related ecological knowledge was considered to be the
					knowledge related to the maintenance, regeneration, and the
					prevention of deterioration of ecosystem functions and services
					used by the community. Finally, we considered as Driving
					force-related the knowledge that informed decisions on what
					expectations and demands for ecosystem services could be met by the
					landscape.</p>

				A total of 898 ecologically relevant individual regulations were

					Some 56% of the 930 pressure-related driving forces (both implicit

						The most frequently regulated pressure relating to forests was the
						felling of trees (83%) (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 1). Sz&#x000e9;kely people used not only timber, but also
						firewood, wood for tools, lumbers and carts. The overuse of oak is
						explicitly referred to several times (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 2). Grazing activities formed 14% of pressures relating to
						forests. Cutting of leaf-fodder was referred to relatively rarely
						(Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 10), but we know from other sources that it formed a
						significant pressure, and hence was forbidden [
						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
						]. Sz&#x000e9;kelys protected forests not only from the grazing of
						leaves, branches and buds by livestock, but also even from
						herdsmen &#x0201c;herding with axes in their hands&#x0201d;.
						Another pressure was the burning of forest litter (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 9) which was in the interest of herdsmen (dead grass
						disappeared and fresh grass grew). Fire damaged trees, and so
						burning was forbidden by the community. As oak acorns and beech
						masts were usually produced only once every 10&#x02009;years
						(sometimes, however, in large quantities [
						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
						,
						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
						]), many villages regulated masting (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 7) (Sz&#x000e9;kelys masted mainly beech, see also [
						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
						]). Since the regional distribution of beech and oak was uneven,
						one village would often mast the territory of another. Some
						villages prohibited masting by foreign pigs.

					<title>Pastures and hay meadows</title>
					<p>
						Village laws distinguished between types of grazing based on
						species, age and the sex of animals, as well as the circumstances
						and the location of grazing (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						). Different regulations can be observed in connection with
						grasslands differing in type and quality. Usually, cattle took
						priority over sheep. In some places, stubble fields, in others,
						fallows, and in most cases, forest cattle pastures were protected
						from sheep (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 17). Hay meadows among the fallows were used as cattle
						pastures and protected against digging by pigs pastured there.
						Separate pastures were maintained by the communities for beasts of
						burden (ox, horse) and protected against other livestock
						(Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 17). In the afternoons and at night, beasts of burden were
						herded into the forests to graze fresh grass [
						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
						]. The grazing of standing hay (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 11) belonging to others was another commonly prohibited
						activity. This is the reason why it was also prohibited for
						individuals to remain outside the village at night (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 16). Punishments differed according to whether the damage
						was accidental or intentional.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since the winters were long, early spring pastures were a scarce
						resource. Therefore, livestock was allowed to graze the early
						growth of hay meadows until Saint George&#x02019;s Day (24
						<sup>th</sup>
						April). In autumn, owing to early frosts in subalpine regions, the
						unmown second growth was also grazed after Michaelmas (29
						<sup>th</sup>
						September). Sz&#x000e9;kelys only rarely cut the second growth on
						hay meadows and manuring was very rare, even at the beginning of
						the 19
						<sup>th</sup>
						century (cf. [
						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
						]). Subalpine shepherds were often hired from other villages.
						Village laws ordered them to stay as long as possible in the
						subalpine region with the sheep. It was forbidden for herders and
						community members to receive foreign cattle or sheep without the
						consent of the community (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 14). Surprisingly, there was no reference to herding- and
						guard-dogs (protection against wolves and bears) in village laws.

						The grazing of green crops was the pressure most commonly
						indicated as a source of damage (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entries 11&#x02013;13). The amount one was fined reflected the
						damage caused to green crops: between 29
						<sup>th</sup>
						September and Christmas, the fine was 40, until Carnival it was
						10, until Easter it was 20 and until harvesting it was 60 units of
						the local currency [
						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
						]. However, grazing on spring cereals, mainly when there was a
						shortage of hay during poor springs, was permitted. Sown fodder
						and grass did not exist during the 17-18
						<sup>th</sup>
						centuries in Sz&#x000e9;kely villages. We hardly found any data
						referring to bush and forest encroachment on grasslands and fallow
						lands. Sometimes, shrubs were eradicated from fallow lands that
						had been abandoned for 10&#x02013;50 years [
						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
						].
					</p>
					<p>
						Grazing by beasts of burden whilst working on the fields also
						caused problems in that it could provide opportunities for
						stealing. Since it was necessary to feed the beasts of burden at
						the scene of the agricultural work, there were strict regulations
						for this (cattle and horses had to be tied to pickets,
						Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 13).
					</p>
					<p>
						Fences were placed around the village and between green crops and
						grazed fallows. It was obligatory to keep the gates shut. Many
						regulations related to gates (112 records, 24% of records in
						Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 12). Sometimes, Sz&#x000e9;kelys strengthened the fences
						by planting willows.
					</p>

					<title>Other pressures</title>
					<p>
						As water was regarded a common resource, it was also protected by
						regulations. Streams were protected against pollution and
						overfishing (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entries 20&#x02013;23). Fishing was prohibited altogether in
						some places, while fishing rights were accorded only to nobles in
						other regions. In some villages, fishing was unrestricted, but
						data for this are scarce. Regulations relating to stream beds
						(Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 24) are referred to surprisingly rarely, and there are no
						data for floods.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even less data refer to hunting e.g. of wolves and bears. The
						shooting of wolves and bears was rewarded. More data are available
						for the beginning of the 19
						<sup>th</sup>
						century. At that time, hunting was permitted in most
						Sz&#x000e9;kely villages (e.g. deer, hare, fox, birds) [
						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
						].
					</p>
					<p>
						As it formed the common property of the communities [
						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
						], the collecting of fruit from fruit trees (mainly apple and
						pear) was strictly regulated in many villages (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entries 26 and 27), and the felling of wild fruit trees was
						strictly prohibited (Table&#x000a0;
						<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>
						, entry 25). The collecting of other non-timber forest products
						(listed in [
						<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
						] for the early 19
						<sup>th</sup>
						century) e.g. wild fruit (

						spp.,
						<italic>Fragaria</italic>
						spp.,
						<italic>Rubus idaeus, R. fruticosus</italic>
						agg.,
						<italic>Corylus avellana</italic>
						) and oak-gall, the honey of wild bees, medicinal plants and fungi
						was not referred to in village laws.

				<title>States and impacts</title>
				<p>States and impacts of ecosystem functions and ecosystem services,
					as well as changes to these, were rarely mentioned in village laws
					(only 2 state and 40 impact records, respectively).</p>
				<p>Explicitly mentioned impacts related mainly to the excessive
					decline in forests and pastures: &#x0201c;forests are so overused
					that shortly, it will not even be possible to find firewood in our
					forests&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;Despite our old laws, the beech-covered
					peaks inherited from our forefathers have almost been
					destroyed&#x02026;unless we forsee these problems (and act
					accordingly), we shall neither find timber nor firewood in these
					forests&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;If ring-barking of forests continues, we
					will have to obtain the required wood from other
					villages.&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;the area for cattle pasture is too
					small&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;due to the overuse of
					forests&#x02026;because of fallen trees, cattle and sheep could not
					graze freely&#x0201d;.</p>
				<p>
					Despite the scarcity of explicit state records, we found many
					different local folk names for habitats, animals and plants in
					village laws (Tables&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>
					and
					<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>
					). We found 71 different folk names for habitats (including
					vegetation types, vegetation-related land-cover and land-use
					categories, 676 records). Habitat categories named after a
					(dominant) plant species were only found in the case of forests and
					arable lands (e.g. beech forest, wheat stubble) (Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>

					<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>
					). Often, certain wood states (Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>
					, entry 1) and species (Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>
					, entry 2) were gathered or felled in certain amounts
					(Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>
					, entry 4) on certain dates (Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>
					, entry 3) and for certain purposes (Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>
					, entry 12), but only after permission had been granted
					(Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>
					, entry 6). Marketing (Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>
					, entry 8) and use by outsiders (Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>
					, entry 9) were often strictly regulated. Valuable forests were
					occasionally managed: nursing oak trees, thinning poorly grown
					beeches and shrubs, thinning out dense forests, removing useless
					wood from forests.

				<p>
					In the case of pastures, regulations focused on seasonal rhythms,
					the quality of forage and the ranking of different animals (by
					species, age, state). Furthermore, Sz&#x000e9;kely people also took
					the nature of the property (private or common) and the remoteness
					of the place into consideration. Grazed forests were protected
					against goats and the cutting of leaf-fodder. The least number of
					responses was found in the case of fallows (Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>
					); uncropped parts were grazed relatively freely. In the case of
					hay meadows, Sz&#x000e9;kely people attempted to prevent the
					grazing, trampling down and stealing of hay.
				</p>
				<p>
					In regulations relating to green crops, the prevention of direct
					stealing and damage caused by trampling and grazing played a major
					role. Here, different punishments were meted out according to the
					species, age and sex of the grazing animal, as well as to the
					circumstances (accidental or deliberate) and place of grazing [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>
					Haywards, who protected crops, hay and trees, played an important
					role in the enforcement of rules (Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>
					, entry 22). Over the years, every member of the community had to
					honour this commitment, with 4&#x02013;20 guards protecting these
					resources, both by night and day [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. If someone resisted doing his duty, he would be fined and forced
					to fulfil his responsibility. If haywards could not present the
					offender who had caused the damage, they had to pay for the latter.
					Haywards were paid both a wage and a reward (one- or two-thirds of
					the fine!) [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>
					The most common form of punishment used for the regulation of
					pressures was a penalty (Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>
					), but compensation and distraint were also common. Physical
					punishment, arrest, decimation, payment in kind and being banned
					from the use of the ecosystem service occurred rarely. Intentional
					and repeated damage or damage caused by outsiders were punished
					more strictly. The penalty was often considerable; it could be as
					much as half the price of an ox.

				<title>The management of the local ecological system</title>
				<p>
					The main (often explicit) purpose of the framing of the
					Sz&#x000e9;kely village laws was to promote the reproduction and
					regeneration of ecosystem services and to prevent shortage in these
					services. A strong sense of &#x0201c;self-awareness&#x0201d; can be
					seen in village laws. Sz&#x000e9;kelys drew up regulations for
					themselves, introduced prohibitions and ordered behaviour and type
					of activity based on their ancient values in order to keep in check
					the selfishness of individuals [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. Sz&#x000e9;kelys argued that a long past and local framing
					legitimized the laws. The variables often encountered in
					functioning commons (e.g. collective-choice rules, leadership,
					norms/social capital and knowledge of the social-ecological system,
					[
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
					]) were also present in our system, though we did not analyse these
					in detail.
				</p>
				<p>
					Written regulations were regularly adjusted as environment and
					society changed (cf. adaptive management [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>
					]) and were often improved as new situations arose. Sometimes the
					Sz&#x000e9;kelys framed new laws: &#x0201c;Human thoughts are
					changing, thus laws must change; it is necessary to adapt them to
					fit the spirit of the times&#x0201d; [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>
					The ecological knowledge and wisdom of previous generations were
					often incorporated and cited by explicitly referring to the
					positive or negative experiences of ancestors. In several cases,
					Sz&#x000e9;kely people openly mentioned also the needs of the
					following generations in their village laws (&#x0201c;The forest
					called Akaszt&#x000f3;fa will never again be sold but will be grown
					on for the next generation.&#x0201d;). Imreh argues that the aim of
					village laws was &#x0201c;to create states that provide safety
					through constancy for the next generations&#x0201d; [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. Sz&#x000e9;kely villagers were motivated and forced to become
					more moderate, careful and self-controlled [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>
					The remarkably fine-tuned regulations were diverse in form. The
					common forms of responses were prohibitions, restrictions and
					activities that could be done only with permission. In our
					particular case, the three main fields of regulation of commons
					(cf. [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
					&#x02013;
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
					]) were also noticeable, namely: restrictions on grazing, limiting
					the felling of trees and regulating water supplies and sources.
					Sz&#x000e9;kely village communities were controlled systems based
					on punishments similar to their Western European counterparts [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
					]. The fine and conscious regulation of private and common
					properties in village laws is illustrated by the planter of fruit
					trees: these not only had the right to the produce of the tree, but
					retained this right even after the field had changed hands [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>Responses restricting the use and supporting the regeneration of
					ecosystem services and responses protecting produced/available
					ecosystem services and ensuring their fair distribution among
					community members also illustrate awareness of regulations and a
					deep understanding of ecological processes. The fine-tuned
					adaptation of regulations to changing social and environmental
					conditions necessitated constant monitoring of the state of the
					environment. In most cases, Sz&#x000e9;kelys were not short of some
					ecosystem services, whereas in others, the shortage did not cause
					any problems (e.g. fungi, certain wild fruits, wild game, fish in
					several cases). These were not regulated by village laws. It is
					interesting that spruce and the regulation of its use were never
					mentioned in village laws.</p>
				<p>In our opinion, the reason for the low number of state records in
					village laws was that it was necessary only to express those states
					in village laws that had strong negative effects on the community.
					Although it is possible to identify and quantify impacts without
					any positive or negative connotations, merely simply by recording a
					change, we discovered that only strong negative impacts had been
					recorded. Thus, the list of explicitly-stated impacts gave a
					distorted picture, since only really dramatic situations requiring
					state reinforcement were recorded in village laws. However,
					implicit reference to impacts was common: e.g. there was/there
					would be insufficient timber, firewood, forage, fodder, fish for
					the future.</p>
				<p>
					During the 270&#x02009;years examined, the strength of regulations
					relating to forests, hay meadows and arable land-use increased [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. This tightening of regulations usually related to
					overexploitation caused by trade and to the intensification of
					agriculture, which was becoming increasingly privately owned.
					Village laws show a remarkably interwoven and carefully organized
					system of cultivation. The village community made decisions about
					which plant should be cultivated and where, the time at which a
					community member was compelled to undertake certain agricultural
					activities and when and which part of the village territory was to
					be used for or protected from grazing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many regulations showed that there was serious competition for
					ecosystem services. Personal and communal interests conflicted. For
					example, the use of slowly regenerating wood conflicted with the
					short-term use of forage and leaf-fodder, whereas, in other cases,
					green crops and hay were protected from grazing for personal goals.
					Data showed that village laws could effectively restrict the
					destructive impact of grazing on communal forest land. Clearing of
					forests that resulted in an increase in the area of arable land and
					hay meadows was supported by the community, but clearing for
					personal purposes was prohibited or, at least, strictly limited.
					Communities limited seigniorial clearings above all. According to
					many village laws, trees could not be sold to outsiders. However,
					commoditization of resources spread during the late 18
					<sup>th</sup>
					century and, as a consequence, the areas of village forests in
					close proximity to big towns and markets had diminished
					considerably by the 19
					<sup>th</sup>
					century [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>
					Village regulations gave a long list of forest uses. The large
					number of uses recorded (55 types) is comparable to the
					50&#x02013;90 types of wood products found by Johann [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
					] for Austria and the 61 types of forest uses documented by
					B&#x000fc;rgi et al. [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
					] for Switzerland.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the 19
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, the Sz&#x000e9;kely village community endeavoured to
					resist the expansion of the Monarchy administrative system. The
					interests of the Habsburg Monarchy and that of the Sz&#x000e9;kely
					communities were different: while the Monarchy would seek to
					transform forests close to the village into taxable arable land,
					communities sought to sustain them as forests [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. The Sz&#x000e9;kelys argued that they could protect ecosystem
					services using locally framed laws and regulate their use [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>
					Sz&#x000e9;kelys aimed for fine-tuned forest use by promoting
					regeneration and by maximizing the felling of trees. The awareness
					of laws is shown by the many explicit messages that refer to
					long-term changes in forest quality. Their goal was to provide wood
					for the &#x0201c;rest&#x0201d; (next generations) in the long run,
					and to promote continuous renewal of the forests, while keeping
					them suitable for grazing (free forests were grazed relatively
					freely). The main goal was to suppress private grazing which could
					cause further damage. The grazing of livestock in herds was easier
					to organize and control [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. Regeneration of valuable forests was promoted not only by
					instituting prohibitions over their use, but sometimes even by
					active forest management. Modern methods of forest regeneration,
					e.g. renewal of forests from seed or the introduction of alien tree
					species were, however, never mentioned. We found that the most
					frequently mentioned problematic pressure was the felling of oak.
					According to village laws, oak was the most valued tree, as it was
					in many other regions of Europe [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
					]. Sz&#x000e9;kelys, by means of their laws, sought to substitute
					the felling of oak with that of less valued species (spruce, beech,
					dead trees and certain pioneer species). Also, the presence of
					hornbeam may have required special attention during the
					regeneration of oak forests, as hornbeam could outcompete oak when
					regeneration was poor (cf. [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>
					]). Felling of spruce forests was never regulated explicitly. These
					forests were mainly far from villages, mostly in the subalpine
					regions, and were still common during the 17-18
					<sup>th</sup>
					centuries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Management of pastures and meadows was less regulated. The main
					goal of village laws was to reduce overuse near villages and
					prevent theft (working in the fields was a good pretext to feed the
					animals and on some occasions, people deliberately drove their
					cattle, with silenced bell, into cereal fields, while drawing aside
					and pretending not to do so intentionally [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]). Spring-time cleaning of hay meadows (e.g. collection of leaf
					litter and twigs, removal of ant hills &#x02013; a common practice
					nowadays in the region, [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
					]) was not mentioned in village laws. Although sheep yielded
					significant profit [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					], the more valuable grasslands were protected from them. In
					adapting to local conditions, sheep were pastured in subalpine
					regions, where grass was poorer.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the 18
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, one grain of wheat, on average, yielded three grains [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. Thus, it is conceivable that under these circumstances both
					theft and prevention of theft were equally important. Regulation of
					theft and other forms of improper behaviour demonstrated that at a
					personal level, Sz&#x000e9;kelys were less moderate, whereas
					village law regulations indicated that at the community level,
					long-term thinking was dominant.
				</p>
				<p>
					In summary, we conclude that Sz&#x000e9;kelys framed responses by
					adapting well to the local, slowly changing internal and external
					driving forces, i.e. they applied adaptive management [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>
					]. Imreh argues, however, that by the 19
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, the open two-field system framework had become too strong
					[
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. The strictly applied common organization of agricultural
					activities gave little room for a higher degree of adaptive
					management based on individual needs (e.g. more optimal manuring of
					arable lands for more efficient maintenance of soil fertility).
				</p>
				<p>
					Increased marketing and trading at the end of the 18
					<sup>th</sup>
					century onwards, as well as financial needs, resulted in
					communities dividing common land: &#x0201c;land was no longer a
					working birthright and the source of food for families, and that
					which maintained communities. Lands became properties that caused
					their owners to drift with business-like thoughts and money-making
					aims towards market&#x0201d; [

				<title>Spatial and temporal scales of village laws</title>
				<p>Sz&#x000e9;kelys regulated the use of ecosystem services on five
					spatial scales: individual trees (fruit trees and trees in
					prohibited forests), the plant community (mostly in the case of
					forests), the habitat mosaic (especially in arable-grassland and
					grassland-forest mosaics), the village territory (inner and outer
					parts of the territory) and sometimes even on a broader scale
					(common territories of several villages).</p>
				<p>
					The village territory provided the space in which the life of the
					Sz&#x000e9;kely village took place, and thus, where its regulations
					applied (landscape ecological scale). The
					&#x02018;ecosystem&#x02019; (sensu [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
					]) was therefore the basic unit of management.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regulations showed that the balance of land-cover categories was
					fine-tuned. For example, the clearing of forests near the village
					and the conversion of pastures into hay meadows was not permitted.
					We argue that Sz&#x000e9;kelys regulated consciously the proportion
					of arable land, pasture, meadow and forest area at this landscape
					ecological scale in order to maximize the long-term exploitation of
					ecosystem services provided by the local landscape. There are data
					available on similar optimized land-use structures from other
					regions of the Carpathian Basin dating from the Middle Ages [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
					]. We found that management on an even coarser spatial scale was
					also present in some cases, e.g. in common forests and common alps
					of several villages, and transhumance by Romanian herdsmen.
				</p>
				<p>
					Areas near the village reached and sometimes exceeded their full
					capacity, but there were also reserves (sometimes significant) in
					the outer territory. Knowledge relating to the limits of
					exploitation was essential in regulating land-use type and
					intensity. The main spatial scale was the habitat mosaic. Areas
					dominated by arable land, oak forests and grasslands with high
					productivity near the village differed from that dominated by
					mountain spruce forests and subalpine outer pastures. A fundamental
					principle of the regulations was to protect the inner territory
					against overuse, and to relocate certain uses to the outer
					territory (cf. [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
					]). For example, herdsmen had to &#x0201c;go far away&#x0201d;;
					subalpine pastures were often leased out to herdsmen from
					neighbouring villages; inner forests and pastures were more subject
					to prohibition; the ring-barking of trees was often permitted in
					the outer forests, but not close to the village. Sz&#x000e9;kelys
					also fine-tuned the grazing of subalpine regions and inner
					pastures: livestock was sent to the subalpine regions as soon as
					they could be grazed there and could only return when there was
					insufficient grass on the mountains. Thus, biomass exploitation of
					the inner and outer sub-systems was connected. Furthermore,
					Sz&#x000e9;kely people protected hay meadows embedded in fallows,
					grasslands embedded in arable lands and hay meadows located between
					grazed forests. The importance of the habitat mosaic scale was
					shown also by the 71 different types of habitat and habitat mosaic
					names mentioned in village laws.
				</p>
				<p>
					A finer spatial scale (the level of the plant community) was
					observed explicitly only for forests. We assume that the management
					of pastures and hay meadows was less adapted to the patchiness in
					vegetation, but data are limited. The well-developed and fine-scale
					management of hay meadows in the 20
					<sup>th</sup>
					century was documented for the nearby Gyimes region, e.g.
					scattering of hayseed, rotation of parcels of land, management of
					wet or mossy patches, selective eradication of certain species,
					eradication of
					<italic>Nardus</italic>
					from certain areas by corralling sheep for the night [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
					], but there are no data relating to the time period in which these
					fine-scale practices developed in the Sz&#x000e9;kelyf&#x000f6;ld
					region.
				</p>
				<p>
					The area of pastures was not defined in village laws and management
					of pastures was regulated only at a landscape scale. We assume that
					herdsmen possessed plant community level ecological knowledge
					(daily and seasonal grazing routes were probably adapted to the
					spatial pattern of more or less useful species and to the grazing
					preference of livestock, (cf. [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
					])). However this was not made explicit, nor was it implicit in the
					regulations. It was generally true that village regulations rarely
					referred to specific uses of wild plant species (except to those of
					trees).
				</p>
				<p>The finest scale regulated was that of individual plants. Cutting
					was prohibited or strongly restricted in case of fruit trees and
					trees of prohibited forests.</p>
				<p>
					The temporal scale of village laws, even explicitly, was very
					large. On the one hand, they had existed &#x0201c;from ancient
					times&#x0201d;. On the other, they were meant &#x0201c;for
					descendants&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;for the coming generations&#x0201d;
					and even &#x0201c;for eternity&#x0201d; [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
					]. Thinking on the century time scale occurred only at this general
					level and concrete, ecological phenomena at this level were not
					mentioned. Changes during the latter decades, e.g. reduction in
					ecosystem services were referred to, often concretely, mainly for
					forests, and rarely for pastures. Regulation of management at the
					decade time scale could only be observed for forests (prohibited
					parts of the forests until they had matured). At the end of the 18
					<sup>th</sup>
					century, owing to the effect of the Enlightenment and capitalism,
					short-term planning started to spread in community management, and
					the effect of trade and individual goals became stronger [

				<p>Village laws were most abundant in Driving force-related and
					Response-related LEEK. In the case of pressure, state and impact,
					it was often difficult to reconstruct the mostly implicit local
					ecological knowledge. The small number of state records would imply
					that every member of the community had knowledge of the good/bad
					ecological conditions of the ecosystems of the village territory.
					While ecologically harmful activities were often emphasized in
					village laws (the prohibition and restriction of some activites),
					ecologically favourable activities were rarely mentioned. We argue
					that the latter might have been common knowledge. It would seem
					that almost every member of the community had a basic level of
					LEEK, and regulations were founded on it. This LEEK was not
					possessed by outsiders and new immigrants to the same degree. A
					profound knowledge of the landscape, the nuanced naming of places
					with toponyms, perception of changes and a knowledge of the
					degradation and regeneration processes of ecological functions and
					services could often be identified in the handing out of legal
					sentences. Responses drafted to prevent decline and degradation
					also demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of ecological processes. In
					general, a more detailed ecological knowledge was observed for
					forests than for grasslands.</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, some aspects of LEEK were so well known within
					Sz&#x000e9;kely communities that they were not made explicit in
					village laws (see the last column of Table&#x000a0;
					<xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>
					). Other significant parts of LEEK remained implicit because they
					were not related to restrictions. For example, the
					Sz&#x000e9;kelys&#x02019; in-depth understanding of fungi was not
					apparent in village laws but is shown by their more recent nuanced
					and still traditional knowledge of different species and their
					habitat preferences in the region (15&#x02013;35 folk fungi taxa
					/village) [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>
					].
				</p>
				<p>It was particularly surprising to find more folk habitat names
					than names for wild animal and plant species in village laws.
					Sz&#x000e9;kely regulations mostly focused on sites, habitats and
					not on species. The reason for this may be that in village laws the
					use of certain sites and habitat types was regulated, and
					Sz&#x000e9;kelys knew from the toponyms that the name referred e.g.
					to a place dominated by oaks.</p>
				<p>
					Comparison of the habitat types mentioned in Sz&#x000e9;kely
					village laws with both recent and historical folk habitat names
					documented in Gyergy&#x000f3; and Gyimes regions [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
					,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
					] revealed a great overlap (e.g. of main forest types and land-use
					types), but a conspicuous lack of reference to spruce forests,
					spring fens, reed beds and stony-rocky places. Presumably, there
					was no need to regulate the use of these habitats.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although Sz&#x000e9;kely people presumably knew the dominant
					grasses and herbs of pastures and hay meadows, surprisingly none of
					these nor the weed species of arable fields were mentioned in
					village laws. According to data collected by Rab [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
					] and Babai and Moln&#x000e1;r [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
					], 150&#x02013;250 wild plant species are known by locals in the
					villages of this region. As most of these names occur in medieval
					sources and toponymes of medieval or earlier origin [
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
					] we argue that the absence of wild plant (and animal) names from
					village laws does not imply a lack of knowledge of these species by
					Sz&#x000e9;kelys.

					The DPSIR framework used in our analysis helped towards the

			<title>Conclusions</title>
			<p>
				The Sz&#x000e9;kely village law is a good example of the sustainable
				way of thinking and of the conscious maintenance of ecosystem
				services. Our analysis showed that laws were based on ecological
				principles and were adapted to the local landscape. Village laws
				were written for the benefit and survival of the community, for the
				protection of public benefits, and for the maintenance of ecosystem
				services [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
				].
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, we suggest that the world&#x02019;s first explicit mention
				of ecosystem services was worded in this region (cited in [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
				]). In 1786, a local Sz&#x000e9;kely official in
				Sepsiszentgy&#x000f6;rgy (Sf&#x000e2;ntu Gheorghe) wrote the
				following about firewood, timber and wood for tools (see the
				original Hungarian text in Table&#x000a0;
				<xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref>
				). &#x0201c;The usefulness, both specific and general, of the
				Regulation of Forest, was intended to provide necessary benefits for
				the Human Community, and this is evidenced by the everyday uses of
				wood; namely for the daily fire, for necessary protection and
				shelter, and for the tools which are necessary for general living.
				Some members of the community abuse these
				<italic>Benefits that are provided by Nature for free</italic>
				(emphasis added by the authors), by the inappropriate, premature
				felling of acorn-bearing trees and trees suitable for timber, and
				this causes obvious harm to our descendants&#x0201d; (cited in [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
				]). Similarly, in another Latin language document dating from 1787
				the expression
				<italic>&#x0201e;inaestimabili naturae beneficio&#x0201d;</italic>
				was used [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
				]. These data predate the findings of Mooney and Ehrlich by nearly
				80&#x02009;years (published in 1864 by G.P. Marsh, cited in [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
				] see also [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>
				]). The early data demonstrates the conscious management of the
				natural environment by the Sz&#x000e9;kelys.

			<p>We conclude that Sz&#x000e9;kely village laws served the long-term
				interest of the local community over shorter-term personal interests
				and also against the Habsburg Monarchy, and helped the conscious and
				sustainable management and protection of ecosystem services for at
				least 300&#x02009;years.</p>
			<p>
				We documented that the Sz&#x000e9;kely community had great adaptive
				capacity to deal with changes in the ecosystem services provided by
				the local landscape, as well as with the increasing pressure of
				external driving forces. This locally regulated resource management
				seems to be crucial in the long-term conservation of landscape and
				biological diversity, and it has likely been a key factor in the
				unique state of preservation of Transylvanian biodiversity (cf. [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>
				]).
			</p>
			<p>
				The cultural and biodiversity-preserving role of the long-term
				application of stable, subsistent-orientated systems is widely
				acknowledged [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>
				]. Research and, if possible, resilient maintenance of these systems
				is extremely important, especially in a time when biodiversity loss
				and global change are having a profound impact on Europe, as well as
				other continents [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
				,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>
				&#x02013;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>
				]. We agree with Scotti and Cadoni [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
				] and Fischer et al. [
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>
				] that direct links between local communities and local landscapes
				are vital to the maintenance of functioning landscapes, local
				biodiversity and cultural heritage. Sz&#x000e9;kely village laws are
				able to provide us with a rich source of ideas for sustainable
				landscape and resource management.
