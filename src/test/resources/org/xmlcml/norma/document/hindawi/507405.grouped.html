                        <p> We investigated the root distribution and nitrogen fixation activity of American
                           jointvetch (
                           <i>Aeschynomene americana</i> L.) cv. Glenn, under waterlogging treatment. The plants were grown in pots under
                           three different treatments: no waterlogging (control), 30 days of waterlogging (experiment
                           1), and 40 days of waterlogging (experiment 2). The plants were subjected to the treatments
                           on day 14 after germination. Root dry matter (DM) weight distribution of waterlogged
                           plants was shallower than controls after day 20 of waterlogging. Throughout the study
                           period, the total root DM weight in waterlogged plants was similar to that in the
                           controls. Enhanced rooting (adventitious roots) and nodule formation at the stem base
                           were observed in waterlogged plants after day 20 of waterlogging. The average DM weight
                           of individual nodules on the region of the stem between the soil surface and water
                           surface of waterlogged plants was similar to that of individual taproot nodules in
                           the controls. Waterlogged plants had slightly greater plant DM weight than the controls
                           after 40 days of treatment. The total nitrogenase activity (TNA) of nodules and nodule
                           DM weight were higher in waterlogged plants than in the controls. Waterlogged American
                           jointvetch had roots with nodules both around the soil surface and in the area between
                           the soil surface and water surface after 20 days of waterlogging, and they maintained
                           high nitrogenase activity and net assimilation rate that resulted in an increased
                           growth rate.

                        <h4 id="sec1">1. Introduction</h4>
                        <p>In Japan, since the 1970s, rice production has undergone many changes, and parts of
                           paddy fields have been used for production of field crops or forage. In recent years,
                           forage production in upland paddy fields has increased. These upland paddy fields
                           comprise approximately 18% of the total forage production area in Japan [
                           <a href="#B1">1</a>]. They are characterized by poor drainage or high ground-water table that results
                           from an inflow of water from the neighboring paddy fields. This inflow of water leads
                           to a very wet soil. Therefore, forage species with high tolerance to wet soils are
                           required in order to maximize the production in these fields. Forage legumes, which
                           introduce nitrogen into pasture and cropping systems, are an integral component of
                           animal feeds, and they make an important contribution to the nutritive value of pastures
                           [
                           <a href="#B2">2</a>–
                           <a href="#B5">5</a>]. However, there are few studies on the cultivation and utilization of tropical forage
                           legumes in drained paddy fields in southern areas of Japan [
                           <a href="#B6">6</a>].
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>During waterlogging, the oxygen concentration in soils decreases, and plant roots
                           experience hypoxia. Plants with roots with low tolerance to waterlogging do not prosper
                           well in wet soils due to decreased root respiration and mineral absorption [
                           <a href="#B7">7</a>–
                           <a href="#B11">11</a>]. Wetland plants and some upland plants can survive under flooding conditions because
                           of the well-developed aerenchyma tissue in their roots [
                           <a href="#B12">12</a>–
                           <a href="#B17">17</a>]. A white, spongy tissue with substantial gas space covers the stem base, roots,
                           and nodules of some flood-tolerant leguminous plants, such as
                           <i> Viminaria juncea</i> [
                           <a href="#B18">18</a>],
                           <i> Lotus uliginosus</i> [
                           <a href="#B19">19</a>, 
                           <a href="#B20">20</a>],
                           <i> Lotus corniculatus</i>,
                           <i> Lotus glaber</i> [
                           <a href="#B21">21</a>], and
                           <i> Glycine max</i> [
                           <a href="#B14">14</a>, 
                           <a href="#B15">15</a>, 
                           <a href="#B22">22</a>]. Under waterlogging conditions, this spongy tissue is connected with the aerenchyma
                           tissues at the nodes. Therefore, this tissue is regarded as a continuous aerenchymatous
                           link and is called secondary aerenchyma [
                           <a href="#B15">15</a>, 
                           <a href="#B23">23</a>]. Plants growing in waterlogged conditions have shallow roots that are distributed
                           near the soil surface [
                           <a href="#B6">6</a>, 
                           <a href="#B24">24</a>–
                           <a href="#B26">26</a>]. Swelling of the submerged portions of the lower shoot [
                           <a href="#B27">27</a>] and development of hypertrophic lenticels [
                           <a href="#B27">27</a>, 
                           <a href="#B28">28</a>] facilitate oxygen entry into the aerenchyma of nearby adventitious roots [
                           <a href="#B29">29</a>]. The swelling of the submerged portions of the lower shoot is probably a consequence
                           of cell expansion promoted by endogenous ethylene formed in the submerged tissue by
                           water [
                           <a href="#B28">28</a>, 
                           <a href="#B29">29</a>]. A more widespread response is the emergence, from the shoot base, of aerenchymatous
                           adventitious roots to replace longer and deeper roots damaged or killed due to anoxia
                           [
                           <a href="#B29">29</a>, 
                           <a href="#B30">30</a>]. In grains such as maize, ethylene promotes the outgrowth of root primordia from
                           the stem base [
                           <a href="#B29">29</a>]. The survival of some species under flooding conditions has been attributed to shallow
                           rooting [
                           <a href="#B31">31</a>]. The wheat lines with shallow roots show higher tolerance to waterlogging than those
                           with deep roots [
                           <a href="#B32">32</a>].
                           
                        </p>
                        <p><i>Aeschynomene americana </i>L. (American jointvetch) cv. Glenn is an erect-ascending, annual or short-lived perennial,
                           shrub-like tropical legume. These plants are native to Central America and the tropical
                           areas of South America, extending from as far south as Argentina to Florida, USA,
                           in the north, and the West Indies [
                           <a href="#B33">33</a>]. Essentially as a wetland plant, it requires a minimum of 1000 mm of mean annual
                           rainfall [
                           <a href="#B33">33</a>].
                           <i> Aeschynomene americana </i>L. cv
                           <i>.</i> Glenn is a self-regenerating annual legume that is released from Florida, USA [
                           <a href="#B34">34</a>]. This plant has a high tolerance to wet conditions [
                           <a href="#B34">34</a>–
                           <a href="#B37">37</a>] and produces a high quantity of dry matter [
                           <a href="#B33">33</a>, 
                           <a href="#B38">38</a>]. Albrecht et al. [
                           <a href="#B39">39</a>] reported that 20-day waterlogged
                           <i> A. americana</i> showed similar nitrogen fixation activity as the controls. Shiferaw et al. [
                           <a href="#B40">40</a>] also reported that 7- and 14-day waterlogged
                           <i> A. americana</i> cv. Glenn showed similar total plant weight and nodule dry weight as the controls.
                           However, there is insufficient information about the growth, root distribution, and
                           nitrogen fixation activity of American jointvetch subjected to more than 30 days of
                           waterlogging. Understanding the growth characteristics of this legume under such conditions
                           will contribute to the management of the productivity of cultivation and livestock

                        <p>In this study, two experiments were conducted to diachronically investigate the root
                           distribution and nitrogen fixation activity of American jointvetch (cv. Glenn) in
                           a waterlogged soil for 30 days (experiment  1) or 40 days (experiment  2). A part
                           of experiment  1 had already been reported [
                           <a href="#B35">35</a>], but it was used here to discuss the results obtained in the present study because
                           little is known about the distribution of roots and nodules according to soil depth.

                        <p>A part of this experiment has already been reported [
                           <a href="#B35">35</a>], and its outline is given below. American jointvetch was sown on May 20, 1992, in
                           pots (inside diameter 12.5 cm, height 40.0 cm, 3 plants per pot) filled with rice
                           paddy soil (heavy soil, pH 5.6; total N, 0.13%; C/N, 13.85; total P, 0.03%), and grown
                           in a phytotron (Biotron Institute, Kyushu University, Japan) under natural light conditions
                           at 25°C and 70% relative humidity. Superphosphate and potassium chloride fertilizers
                           were added to the soil in each pot (0.123 g pot
                           <sup>−1</sup> of P and K). Rhizobia were not inoculated because it was shown that adequate amounts
                           of rhizobia strain suitable for this plant (cowpea type) exist in paddy soil [
                           <a href="#B38">38</a>].
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>There were two treatments each with three replicates. Pots in the nonwaterlogging
                           treatment group (control) were watered daily to field capacity and allowed to drain
                           freely, while pots with 30-day waterlogging treatment were watered daily to maintain
                           the water level at 2 cm above the soil surface and the bottom of the pot was corked.
                           Treatments began on day 14 after emergence.
                        </p>
                        <p>Plants were collected at the start of the treatment (0) and 10, 20, and 30 days later.
                           Dry matter (DM) weight (70°C, 72 h) and root distribution were measured. Plants were
                           cut at the soil surface and the roots were cut every 5 cm from the soil surface to
                           a soil depth of 40 cm. Root parts were washed and soil was carefully removed. Nodules
                           were separated from roots for measurement of DM weight.

                        <p>American jointvetch sown on May 11, 1995, in pots (1/5000a Wagner pot, 3 plants per
                           pot) filled with paddy soil (same as experiment 1) was grown in a phytotron (Biotron
                           Institute) under natural light conditions at 25°C. Superphosphate and potassium chloride
                           fertilizers were added to the soil in each pot (0.2 g pot
                           <sup>−1</sup> of P and K).

                        <p>There were two treatments, each with three replicates. Pots in the nonwaterlogging

                           the water level at 2 cm above the soil surface and the bottom of the pot was corked.
                           Treatments began on day 14 after emergence. Like in experiment  1, rhizobia were not
                           inoculated in experiment  2 as well.

                        <p>Soil oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) was measured from the start of the treatment
                           (0) to 40 days of waterlogging treatment by ORP electrode (9300-10D, Horiba Inc.,
                           Kyoto, Japan). Plants were collected at the start of the treatment (0) and 2, 5, 11,
                           20, and 40 days later. DM weight and nitrogen fixation activity were measured with
                           the acetylene reduction method [
                           <a href="#B35">35</a>, 
                           <a href="#B41">41</a>]. Root distribution was determined by separating the lateral roots from the taproot.
                           The total nitrogenase activity (TNA) of nodules was measured separately in the above-ground
                           parts and subterranean parts of the plants. Each part of the plant was put into a
                           1-L glass jar, and the air in the jar was adjusted so that it contained 5% acetylene.
                           Plants were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature (about 25°C). Then, 1.0 mL
                           of gas was collected from the jar and injected into a gas chromatograph (GC-6A, Shimazu
                           Inc., Kyoto, Japan; with Porapak Q + Porapak N, conditions: injection temperature
                           50°C, column temperature 50°C, and FID detection temperature 50°C) to measure the
                           volume of ethylene. Specific nitrogenase activity (SNA) was calculated from TNA and

                           <a href="#B29">29</a>]. The swelling is a consequence of cell expansion promoted by endogenous ethylene
                           trapped by water in the submerged tissue [

                           <a href="#B29">29</a>]. Under waterlogging conditions, aerenchymatous adventitious roots emerge from the
                           shoot base to replace longer and deeper roots damaged or killed by anoxia [

                           <a href="#B30">30</a>]. In maize, ethylene promotes the outgrowth of root primordia from the stem base

                           <a href="#B29">29</a>]. The ability of some species to survive waterlogging was attributed to shallow rooting
                           [
                           <a href="#B31">31</a>], and those species can reorientate root extension to a more horizontal or even upright
                           direction and thus towards zones where oxygen may be more readily available [
                           <a href="#B29">29</a>]. Developing an adventitious root system is an important strategy that plants use
                           to avoid anoxia [
                           <a href="#B29">29</a>, 
                           <a href="#B31">31</a>]. We believe that the thickening of the stem base starts immediately after the treatment,
                           and the root distribution around the soil surface and in the area between the soil
                           surface and water surface is the result of the tolerance that the American jointvetch
                           has developed to waterlogging.

                           cannot bring about nodulation and nitrogen fixation without a supply of photosynthates
                           from the host plants. Waterlogging-induced anaerobic conditions in the soil are harmful
                           to the formation and function of nodules in several legume species [

                           <a href="#B49">49</a>] and is attributable to the adverse effects of waterlogging on rhizobial populations,
                           decreased frequency of root infection [

                           <a href="#B50">50</a>]. The anaerobic conditions may reduce the energy supply available for the formation
                           of nodules [

                           <a href="#B52">52</a>]. However, in our experiment, TNA, SNA, and nodule weights in plants subjected to
                           waterlogging treatments were similar to or higher than those in the controls (Figures

                           <a target="_blank" href="fig9/">9</a>). The waterlogged plants had larger individual nodules (Figure 
                           <a target="_blank" href="fig5/">5</a>) located around the soil surface (0–5 cm below the soil surface) and in the area
                           between the soil surface and water surface (Figures 
                           <a target="_blank" href="fig2/">2</a> and 
                           <a target="_blank" href="fig4/">4</a>) as well as higher TNA in the above-ground plant parts (Figure 
                           <a target="_blank" href="fig8/">8</a>) than the controls after 20 days of treatment. The SNA 2 days after waterlogging
                           treatment showed the highest value during the experimental period (Figure 
                           <a target="_blank" href="fig9/">9</a>). We were not able to explain this pathogenesis. Highly wet-tolerant plants develop
                           aerenchyma tissue in the roots and transport gases (e.g., O
                           <sub>2</sub> and N
                           <sub>2</sub>) from foliage to roots when exposed to waterlogging [

                           <a href="#B54">54</a>]. These plants maintain a high level of nodule formation and nitrogen fixation activity
                           when waterlogged [

                           <a href="#B55">55</a>]. Albrecht et al. [
                           <a href="#B39">39</a>] reported that waterlogged
                           <i> A. americana</i> showed similar nitrogen fixation activity to the controls and hypothesized that this
                           was because the gases for nitrogen fixation were transported through an aerenchyma
                           in waterlogged plants. Loureiro et al. [
                           <a href="#B56">56</a>], using a transmission electron microscopy method, observed aerenchyma and spongy
                           tissue at the base of the nodule that connected both stem and root nodules to a large
                           intercellular space in the cortex of
                           <i> Aeschynomene fluminensis</i>. Yoshida [
                           <a href="#B54">54</a>] reported that the gases necessary for nitrogen fixation were mainly transferred
                           to the root system through an aerenchyma in waterlogged
                           <i> Aeschynomene indica.</i> Tobisa et al. [
                           <a href="#B37">37</a>], in their greenhouse experiment of 30 days of waterlogging treatment of the same
                           genus
                           <i> Aeschynomene</i> (three
                           <i> A. americana</i> strains and two
                           <i> Aeschynomene villosa</i> strains), reported that nitrogen fixation activity and nodule DM weight in the waterlogged
                           plants were higher than those in the control group starting from 7 days after germination.
                           In the present study, we observed similar nitrogen fixation activity in waterlogged
                           and control
                           <i> Aeschynomene americana</i>. These results indicate that the delay in growth in the first 20 days of waterlogging
                           treatment is caused by the initial employment of the photosynthate for aerenchyma
                           formation, nodulation, and nitrogen fixation. As shown in previous studies, after
                           20 d of treatment, the plants acquire tolerance to waterlogging, and the growth resumes
                           [
                           <a href="#B35">35</a>, 
                           <a href="#B37">37</a>]. In addition, in the present study, the lateral root nodule DM weight in waterlogged
                           plants after 40 days of treatment became lower than that in the control (Figure 
                           <a target="_blank" href="fig4/">4</a>). This suggests that the rate of aerenchyma formation in lateral root is slower compared
                           to the aboveground stem, and the nodules that are formed in the aboveground stem develop
                           more aerenchyma than the lateral roots. Additionally, these results indicate that
                           the nodules formed in the aboveground stem promote TNA after 20 days of waterlogging
                           treatment.

                        <p>Stem nodulation has been reported in 21 species of the genus
                           <i> Aeschynomene</i>, three species of the genus
                           <i> Sesbania</i>, and
                           <i> Neptunia oleracea</i> [
                           <a href="#B57">57</a>]. Ladha et al. [
                           <a href="#B57">57</a>] divided stem-nodulating legumes into three groups. Most of
                           <i> Aeschynomene</i> species that have stems with visible nodules/root primordia but form nodules mainly
                           on the submerged stems are included in group 2.
                           <i> Aeschynomene americana</i> was not included in that study [
                           <a href="#B56">56</a>], but, based on the characteristics of the stem nodule formation, we believe that
                           it should belong to this group. Stem nodulation is more important than the root nodulation
                           for plant nitrogen fixation and dual (stem and root) nodulation results in higher
                           rate of nitrogen fixation than single (root) nodulation [
                           <a href="#B57">57</a>]. In
                           <i> Sesbania rostrata</i>, stem nodules appear at approximately 4 weeks of age and account for more than 80%
                           of total acetylene reduction activity, which further increases to almost 100% between
                           4 and 7 weeks of age [
                           <a href="#B58">58</a>]. In this study, the proportion of DM weight of above-ground nodules and TNA increased
                           with increasing waterlogging period; this result is in agreement with those of previous
                           studies [
                           <a href="#B57">57</a>,

                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, we found that waterlogged American jointvetch plants have basal stem
                           thickening from 2 days of waterlogging treatment and roots with nodules that are distributed
                           both around the soil surface and in the area between the soil surface and water surface
                           after 20 days of waterlogging. The plants maintained high nitrogenase activity and
                           net assimilation rate, which in turn increased the above-ground nodule DM weight,
                           TNA, growth, and yield. However, in our study, hypocotyl (secondary) aerenchyma was
                           not observed in the waterlogged plants. Therefore, future studies are needed to investigate
                           the aerenchyma development and metabolic activity in the roots and nodules in waterlogged
                           American jointvetch plants.
