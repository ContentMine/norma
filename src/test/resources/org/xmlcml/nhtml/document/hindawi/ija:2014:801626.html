              <p>
                One of the major problems that potentially hinders the use of
                foliar fertilization as a tool to improve nutrient use
                efficiency is the lack of effective formulations. A phosphite
                based product, Nutri-phite (3% N, 8.7% P, and 5.8% K) was used
                as model phosphite formulation for foliar application in winter
                wheat (
                <i>Triticum aestivum</i>
                L). Five field trials were established in the fall of 2009 and
                2010 at Perkins, Perry, and Morrison, OK. Treatments encompassed
                the application of nitrogen (N) at 100 or 75% of crop need and
                phosphorus at 100 (P 100%) and 80% (P 80%) sufficiency with and
                without Nutri-phite. Nutri-phite was applied at one and/or two
                stages of wheat; GS 13 to 14 and GS 49 to 53 at the rate of 433
                and 148 g ha
                <sup>−1</sup>
                P and N, respectively. Grain yield was increased by Nutri-phite
                treatments, especially at Morrison. Grain P concentration of
                plots treated with two applications of Nutri-phite ranged from
                13 to 55% more than the nontreated and standard NP received
                plots at Perkins in 2009/10 and Perry in 2010/11. Grain P uptake
                was increased due to application of Nutri-phite at Perkins in
                2009/10 and Morrison and Perry in 2010/11. Combined over three
                year-locations, Nutri-phite increased grain P concentration by
                11.6%. The higher grain P concentration of plots treated with
                Nutri-phite compared to the other treatments clearly
                demonstrates its potential in improving P status of wheat grain.

              <h4 id="sec1">1. Introduction </h4>
              <p>
                Phosphorus is second only to nitrogen in importance as an
                essential crop nutrient. It is critical for plant growth,
                especially in the early jointing stages (GS 31 on Zadoks growth
                stage scale) and for enhancing grain yield and yield components
                [
                <a href="#B1">1</a>
                ]. Phosphorus is important in building energy for metabolism of
                plant growth through cellular productions such as ATP and ADP
                from the early stages to the end of the plant’s life. It is
                stored as polyphosphate and in plant vacuole tissue [
                <a href="#B2">2</a>
                ]. Several researchers have reported that there are many issues
                that affect P availability to the plant when it is applied
                directly in soil [
                <a href="#B3">3</a>
                –
                <a href="#B7">7</a>
                ]. In acidic soil, P is adsorbed by Al
                <sup>3+</sup>
                , Fe
                <sup>3+</sup>
                , and Mg
                <sup>2+</sup>
                at soil pH 6 to 6.5. In alkaline soils, P is adsorbed by calcium
                carbonate and becomes unavailable to plants [
                <a href="#B8">8</a>
                ]. Moreover, the recycling of P in soil is considered slow
                because it gets fixed and adsorbed on soil particles [
                <a href="#B7">7</a>
                ,
                <a href="#B8">8</a>
                ]. More than 80% of soil P is unavailable for plant use [
                <a href="#B5">5</a>
                ,
                <a href="#B6">6</a>
                ,
                <a href="#B8">8</a>
                ]. Mosali et al. [
                <a href="#B5">5</a>
                ] found that application of broadcast-incorporated preplant
                fertilizer at 11 to 22 kg ha
                <sup>−1</sup>
                P was required for cereal [
                <a href="#B3">3</a>
                ,
                <a href="#B4">4</a>
                ]. The cost associated with traditionally applied P fertilizers
                has also become an issue for many producers, especially as P use
                efficiency (PUE) is considered very poor because of P behavior
                in soil [
                <a href="#B9">9</a>
                ].
              </p>
              <p>
                Foliar fertilization of nutrients, especially P, in major cereal
                crops has been evaluated to improve nutrient use efficiency [
                <a href="#B5">5</a>
                ,
                <a href="#B10">10</a>
                ]. The time and method of foliar P fertilizer application are
                critical factors for increasing wheat grain yield. McBeath et
                al. [
                <a href="#B11">11</a>
                ] reported that foliar P fertilizer increased grain yield, grain
                P uptake, and the transfer of P to grain. Sherchand and Paulsen
                [
                <a href="#B12">12</a>
                ] examined four sources of foliar P fertilizer applied at the
                flowering stage of winter wheat and found that the grain yield
                was increased by foliar P fertilizer with the exception of
                phytic acid. Shoot growth, leaf area, and chlorophyll of maize
                were increased by the foliar application of P fertilizer [
                <a href="#B13">13</a>
                ]. Mosali et al. [
                <a href="#B5">5</a>
                ] reported a linear relationship between P grain concentration
                and foliar treatments of P at Lahoma and a slight effect on P
                uptake, especially at second detectable node (GS 32) stage.
                Phosphorus absorption and metabolism in the plant was very fast
                when P was applied as a foliar fertilizer when compared to
                traditional P soil fertilizer application [
                <a href="#B14">14</a>
                ]. Mosali et al. [
                <a href="#B5">5</a>
                ] found that delaying foliar P application to head completely
                emerged (GS 58) stage increased PUE by 8% as compared to the
                same application at GS 32. In corn, Girma et al. [
                <a href="#B10">10</a>
                ] reported a greater foliar PUE at 2 kg ha
                <sup>−1</sup>
                P when applied at growth stage V8 compared to 4 and 8 kg ha
                <sup>−1</sup>
                P applied at the same stage. Foliar P increased wheat PUE by 28%
                compared with preplant P fertilizer applied to the soil [
                <a href="#B15">15</a>
                ]. There is a need to improve PUE as well as P concentration in
                grain and plant tissues. In addition, using foliar P application
                methods is considered the best way to reduce the amount of P
                fertilizer required as a soil fertilizer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many factors affect the absorption or uptake of foliar
                fertilizer. The first factor is the cuticle layers on the plant
                leaves. Foliar applied inorganic nutrients are absorbed through
                leaves in a two-step process in which they penetrate the cuticle
                (passive percolation or surface adsorption) and then pass
                through (active absorption) the cells below the cuticle layers [
                <a href="#B16">16</a>
                –
                <a href="#B20">20</a>
                ]. Light, temperature, and relative humidity affect the opening
                of stomata which will, in turn, affect absorption of nutrients [
                <a href="#B16">16</a>
                ,
                <a href="#B18">18</a>
                ]. The uptake of foliar fertilizer is affected by temperature
                and relative humidity when a thin layer of moisture is formed on
                the leaves by transpiration [
                <a href="#B21">21</a>
                ]. Past research showed that at high temperatures, cuticle
                adhesiveness increases, surface tension increases, and nutrients
                are increasingly diffused through the cuticle and stomata [
                <a href="#B22">22</a>
                ]. Furthermore, P absorption is also affected by leaf age (upper
                and lower leaf), wetting of leaf surface, and solution droplet
                angle [
                <a href="#B23">23</a>
                –
                <a href="#B25">25</a>

                ,
                <a href="#B27">27</a>
                ]. Phosphorus was rapidly absorbed at low solution PH compared
                to high solution PH. Römer and Schilling [
                <a href="#B1">1</a>
                ] reported that applied P at GS 31 to 39 (flag leaf ligule and
                collar visible) at 1 ppm rate increased grain yield compared
                with GS 75 (medium milk stage) at the same application rate.
                Several papers reported the impact of foliar P fertilizer on the
                grain yield of wheat, PUE, and P grain concentration. Potassium

                Research showed that one of the potential hindrances for the use
                of foliar application as a tool to improve nutrient use
                efficiency is the lack of a good formulation that can be easily
                absorbed by cereal leaves [
                <a href="#B9">9</a>
                ]. Several products including powdered forms of diammonium
                phosphate (DAP), triple superphosphate (TSP), monoammonium
                phosphate (MAP), and potassium phosphate monobasic salt have
                been evaluated with limited success [
                <a href="#B15">15</a>
                ]. Some of these products were not small enough for entry
                through the leaf, while others, like potassium phosphate
                monobasic, dried quickly resulting in poor entry into the leaf [
                <a href="#B10">10</a>
                ]. Phosphite (PO
                <sub>3</sub>
                ) based formulations such as Nutri-phite are proposed as
                alternatives to overcome problems associated with absorption of
                P through leaf tissue and to thereby improve nutrient use
                efficiency, boost crop yield, and increase grain quality [
                <a href="#B29">29</a>
                ,
                <a href="#B30">30</a>
                ]. Nutri-phite contains phosphite (PO
                <sub>3</sub>
                ) and a blend of organic acids that stabilize and safens the
                phosphite molecule that is taken up by leaves of plants. It is
                composed of 3% N, 8.7% P, and 5.8% K. The compound is designed
                to improve nutrient use efficiency by plants including major
                nutrients such as N and P. Phosphite based formulations have
                been used in many horticultural crops; however, they have not
                been tested in major cereals like corn (
                <i>Zea mays</i>
                L.) and wheat. In this study, Nutri-phite was used as model
                phosphite formulation for foliar application in wheat. The goal
                of most agricultural producers is to obtain optimal crop yields
                with minimum input from fertilizers and to minimize negative
                environmental impacts of agricultural operations [
                <a href="#B30">30</a>
                ]. It is imperative to evaluate methods to reduce the cost and
                loss of P fertilizer critical for wheat producers so that they
                can achieve their goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                The hypothesis of this study was the application of phosphite as
                Nutri-phite with and without the addition of soil applied P at
                100, and 80% sufficiency would increase and/or improve growth,
                grain yield, and grain quality of hard red winter wheat. Thus,
                the objective of this study was to determine whether phosphite
                (Nutri-phite) application with or without preplant P (100 and
                80% sufficiency) fertilizer at two growth stages (GS 13 to 14
                and GS 49 to 53 growth stages) at the rate of 4 Lha
                <sup>−1</sup>
                would increase hard red winter wheat grain yield and P uptake
                and concentration.

              <p>Five winter wheat field experiments were established over the
                fall of 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 in three locations. Two fields
                were chosen in 2009/2010, one at Perkins (35° 59′ 18.2394′′ lat

                Soil samples were collected and analyzed from 0 to 30 cm (1 ft)
                for available N and P in the soil prior to initiation of the
                experiment. This information was used to calculate N and P

                <sup>−1</sup>
                in the case of N and 100% and 80% sufficiency in the case of P [
                <a href="#B31">31</a>

                <sup>−1</sup>
                N to achieve the yield goal. Nitrogen as urea (46% N-0% P-0% K)
                was split 1/3 and 2/3 between preplant and jointing stage,
                respectively. All soil applied P was determined based on
                percentage sufficiency and was applied as a preplant application
                using triple superphosphate (0% N-20% P-0% K). Phosphorus was
                applied at 17.5 and 20.8 kg ha
                <sup>−1</sup>
                P to attain 80 and 100% sufficiency. Based on soil analysis
                results, K was not needed for any of the experimental sites

                October 11, 2010 at Perkins. Duster was replaced with Endurance
                to avoid a potential confounding effect and yield loss that

                (kg ha
                <sup>−1</sup>

                <sup>−1</sup>
                ), and gain P uptake. Wheat was harvested at maturity by
                harvesting the center 2 m using a Massey Ferguson 8XP
                experimental combine. The combine was equipped with a Harvest
                Master automated weighing system (Harvest Master Inc., Logan,
                Utah). Grain subsamples from each treatment were collected for
                determining grain P concentration. The subsamples were dried in
                a forced air oven at 66°C, ground to pass a 140 mesh sieve (100
                mm), and analyzed for total P using inductively coupled plasma

                The analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that locations and
                treatments significantly affected grain yield, grain P
                concentration, and P uptake over the two years of the study
                (Table
                <a target="_blank" href="tab3/">3</a>
                ). Productive tillers per plant at harvesting stage were
                recorded in 2009/10 only. Plant height (cm) at physiological
                maturity was not affected by treatments and thus results are not
                included for this measurement.

              <p>
                Grain yield was significantly affected by treatments among the
                locations (Table
                <a target="_blank" href="tab4/">4</a>
                ). In 2009/2010, at Perkins and Perry study sites, there was no
                significant effect of treatments on grain yield. In 2010/11 at
                Perkins, all treatments had significantly higher yield than the
                nontreated plots (Table
                <a target="_blank" href="tab4/">4</a>
                ). However, yield was not different among Nutri-phite, soil
                applied N and P fertilizers, or their combination. In 2010/11,
                at Morrison grain yield increased due to application of
                Nutri-phite compared to control treatments. Nutri-phite resulted
                in 70% more grain yield than the nontreated. At this location in
                2010/11 Nut2x in combination with N 75% and P 80% increased
                grain yield by 520 kg ha
                <sup>−1</sup>
                compared to N 75% and P 80% treatment (without Nutri-phite). At
                Perry in 2010/11, Nutri-phite did not significantly increase
                grain yield compared to standard treatment (NP 100%). Likewise,
                there was no grain yield difference between Nutri-phite,
                nontreated, and P 100% treatments. Additionally, at Perry in
                2010/11, grain yield increased (254 kg ha
                <sup>−1</sup>
                ) by using Nutri-phite in combination with N 75% and P 80%
                compared to N 75% and P 80% without Nutri-phite, regardless of
                application frequency. However, there was no significant grain
                yield difference between Nutri-phite and preplant P 100% in both
                fields (Morrison and Perry) in 2010/11. The current results
                agreed with Mosali et al. [
                <a href="#B5">5</a>
                ] and Torres [
                <a href="#B15">15</a>
                ] who found a negligible effect of foliar P on the grain yield
                of wheat especially at G32 (second detectable node) as foliar P
                was applied with a preplant fertilizer. In contrast, the
                application of 2 kg ha
                <sup>−1</sup>
                P foliar at the V8 (collar of eighth leaf unfolded) corn growth
                stage affected yield and PUE [
                <a href="#B9">9</a>
                ]. This could be attributed to variations in soil and weather
                conditions, especially moisture (Figure
                <a target="_blank" href="fig1/">1</a>
                ). Moisture and temperature may affect the opening of the
                stomata, which consequently may affect absorption and the
                movement of Nutri-phite throughout leaf tissues. Light,
                temperature, and relative humidity are the most critical
                environmental conditions influencing the opening of the stomata,
                which then affect absorption and evaporation of foliar nutrient
                [
                <a href="#B16">16</a>
                ,
                <a href="#B18">18</a>
                ,
                <a href="#B21">21</a>
                ,
                <a href="#B22">22</a>
                ]. The lack of response to P at Perkins and Perry in 2009/2010
                could also be due to the high levels of P concentration in the
                soils of this study (Table
                <a target="_blank" href="tab2/">2</a>
                ) making the effect of additional P fertilizer minimal.

              <p>
                Although there was no significant effect of treatment on grain
                yield at Perkins in 2009/10, grain P concentration was
                significantly affected by treatments (Table
                <a target="_blank" href="tab5/">5</a>
                ). Nutri-phite treatment resulted in greater grain P
                concentration (4095 mg kg
                <sup>−1</sup>
                ) compared to nontreated and NP 100% (745 and 815 mg kg
                <sup>−1</sup>
                more, resp.). In 2010/11 at Perry, application of Nutri-phite at
                the two growth stages of wheat (Nutr2x) with preplant P 100%
                resulted in highest grain P concentration (3950 mg kg
                <sup>−1</sup>
                ). Similarly, application of Nutr2x with preplant N and/or P at
                both sufficiency levels resulted in higher grain P concentration
                than the NP 100% treatment. However, the effect of Nutri-phite
                was not consistent among the treatments at both locations. Grain
                P concentration of wheat might be increased, when foliar P was
                sprayed at anthesis [
                <a href="#B12">12</a>
                ]. The higher grain P concentration of plots treated with foliar
                Nutri-phite clearly demonstrates its potential in improving P
                status of wheat grain. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for a
                healthy life due to its role in bone and teeth formation and
                maintenance, improved digestion, energy storage, and protein and
                hormone synthesis [
                <a href="#B34">33</a>
                –
                <a href="#B36">35</a>
                ]. Harder et al. [
                <a href="#B37">36</a>
                ] reported that P in grain was increased by 4.7% by foliar
                fertilization compared with the control. Furthermore, Pellerin
                et al. [
                <a href="#B38">37</a>
                ] concluded that high P concentration in grain might improve
                yield or be kept in the seed as P, which is ultimately needed
                for germination and initial development of seedlings. The low
                grain P concentration in the N received treatments might be
                attributed to the inverse concentration relationship of the two
                nutrients. Coblentz et al. [
                <a href="#B39">38</a>
                ] reported a decline in P concentration in the forage of
                bermudagrass with increase in nitrogen rate.

                <a target="_blank" href="tab6/">6</a>
                ). The effect of treatments on grain P uptake was not consistent
                across site-years. At Perkins, the highest P uptake (166% more
                than N 75% and P 80% treatment) was exhibited with the Nutr2x
                treatment (Table
                <a target="_blank" href="tab6/">6</a>
                ) followed by NP 100% with or without Nutr1x. The grain P uptake
                of the nontreated treatment was not significantly different from
                the Nutr2x or any other treatment at this location. A contrast
                between Nutri-phite applied versus preplant fertilizer applied
                plots did not result in a statistically significant P uptake
                (data not shown). At Morrison in 20010/11, grain P uptake was
                greatest with the N 75% and P 80% + Nutr2x treatment. This
                treatment resulted in 136% more grain P uptake than the
                nontreated plots. Applying Nutri-phite in this field with or
                without preplant fertilizer did increase P uptake by more than
                80% compared to the nontreated.

                Similar to Perkins in 2009/2010, at Perry in 2010/11 the
                application of Nutri-phite with and without preplant fertilizer
                did not significantly increase P uptake. Over all, using
                Nutri-phite with and without preplant fertilizer did not
                increase P uptake compared to only preplant fertilizer
                application (both N and P). However, averaged over locations
                that showed significant treatment effect, Nutri-phite
                application improved grain P uptake compared with the nontreated
                check. In all locations in 2010/11 rainfall during the peak crop
                growth was suboptimal (Figure
                <a target="_blank" href="fig1/">1</a>
                ) which might have interfered with P assimilation into grain. It
                could also be due to high soil P amount and other growing
                conditions [

                number of tillers followed by N 75% and P 80% + Nutr2x
                treatment, which was not different from the other treatments

                Nutr2x had the greatest number of tillers. The Nutr2x treatment

              <p>Nutri-phite (Nutr1x and Nutr2x) with and without preplant
                fertilizer in all fields did not affect grain yield of wheat,
                but there was a significant effect on grain P concentration.
                Grain yield determined by ANOVA was marginally increased by the
                combination of Nutri-phite (Nutr1x and Nutr2x) with N 75% and P
                80%, but the 100% preplant P treatment was not consistent in
                grain yield. There was significant difference between
                Nutri-phite (Nutr2x) and check treatment (nontreated) in grain
                yield. Nutri-phite (Nutr2x) resulted in more grain P
                concentration compared to nontreated and NP 100% treatment.
                Likewise, combining Nutri-phite (Nutr1x and Nutr2x) with P 100%
                treatments resulted in increase in grain P concentration.
                Combined over three year-locations, Nutri-phite increased grain
                P concentration by 11.6%. The P uptake of grain was increased by
                Nutri-phite application, especially with Nutr2x compared to
                nontreated. Nutri-phite treatments resulted in more P uptake
                than preplant applied P. This study demonstrated that the
                application of Nutri-phite treatments as foliar P fertilizer
                might enhance and/or improve the wheat grain yield and grain
                quality, especially under good environmental conditions.
                Additionally, future foliar P fertilization should focus on the
                amount of foliar fertilizer applied and the best time of the
                crop life cycle to get the benefit of foliar application. Our
                results conform to previous finding that foliar P should be used
                to supplement soil applied P to improve wheat quality as
                demonstrated through high grain P concentration.</p>
