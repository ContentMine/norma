Couple this with the increasing nitrogen (N) fertilizer costs and environmental concerns and the need for proper management practices has increased. A trial was established to evaluate the effects of different preplant N fertilizer sources on maize cultivated under deficit irrigation or rain-fed conditions on grain yield, N use efficiency (NUE), and water use efficiency (WUE). Two fertilizer sources, ammonium sulfate (AS) and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), applied at two rates, 90 and 180&#x2009;kg&#x2009;N&#x2009;ha<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, were evaluated across four site-years.

Producers applying N preplant as a single application should adjust rates based on a reasonable yield goal and production practice.</p><span class="end-abs"/><h4 id="sec1">1. Introduction</h4><p>Over the last two decades, the number of maize hectares planted and harvested in the Southern Great Plains of the United States has increased. While the number of irrigated hectares has remained fairly constant over this time span, the increase in rain-fed hectares has more than doubled [<a href="#B1">1</a>]. This rise in area cultivated to maize is due to increased demand for maize for livestock feed exports and maize-based ethanol production [<a href="#B2">2</a>]. With this increased production and an ever-growing concern for environmental implications, sustainable production practices that maximize the use of resources are being sought.</p><p/><p/><p>In some portions of the Southern Great Plains, groundwater is available for irrigation of maize production. However, in areas, such as the Ogallala Aquifer, the amount of water extracted from the aquifer has been much greater than the amount recharged leading to drastic declines in the water table which can exceed 50 percent of the saturated thickness [<a href="#B3">3</a>]. One method utilized to better maximize maize grain yield and water use efficiency (WUE) has been deficit irrigation. Deficit irrigation is a management practice in which irrigation is applied below the evapotranspiration (ET) level at critical growth stages without significant reduction in grain yields [<a href="#B4">4</a>]. The most critical growth stage at which moisture stress has been observed to be the most yield limiting in maize is the two weeks prior and the two weeks following silking [<a href="#B5">5</a>]. Irrigation during the reproductive stages can still produce optimum grain yields and maximize WUE [<a href="#B6">6</a>, <a href="#B7">7</a>].</p><p>The inefficient use of N fertilizer has been one of the major focal points for environmental contamination. A considerable factor affecting maize grain yield and N use efficiency (NUE) is the chemical make-up of the N fertilizer source. The source of the N fertilizer can impact the potential rate of loss and/or availability of the fertilizer [<a href="#B8">8</a>]. According to Tsai et al. [<a href="#B9">9</a>], utilizing ammoniacal-based N fertilizer sources may reduce potential losses via leaching and denitrification and may extend the availability of N in the soil for plant uptake throughout the growing season. Stevenson and Baldwin [<a href="#B10">10</a>] compared the effects of ammonium nitrate, urea, and anhydrous ammonia applied at different times in maize. Regardless of application time, anhydrous ammonia yielded 240 to 260&#x2009;kg&#x2009;ha<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> more than both ammonium nitrate and urea. Power et al. [<a href="#B11">11</a>] evaluated the effects of ammonium sulfate (AS), ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate, and urea on maize grain yield and dry matter production. They reported that maize dry matter increased significantly with fertilization; however, grain yield differences among the different N sources were seldom significant. The ammoniacal sources typically displayed increased dry matter production with increasing N rates when compared to the calcium nitrate treatments while urea treatments were less than the other two ammoniacal sources. Olson et al. [<a href="#B12">12</a>] compared anhydrous ammonia to urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) that was applied at planting or sidedress. They reported that anhydrous ammonia yielded more than the UAN treatment. They attributed the decreased yields in the UAN treatments to the nitrate component, which has the potential for being lost through leaching or denitrification, and the urea component, which has greater potential for N losses via ammonia volatilization. Freeman et al. [<a href="#B8">8</a>] investigated the use of urea and anhydrous ammonia applied at different times with different soil incorporation procedures. They concluded that both grain yield and N uptake were improved when the N fertilizer source was urea, but only if the urea was applied and incorporated preplant or after harvest when residue incorporation is practiced.</p><p>The NUE and WUE of maize hybrids often coincide with one another [<a href="#B13">13</a>] because of the greater response to N fertilizer with increases in added water [<a href="#B14">14</a>, <a href="#B15">15</a>]. Because of this relationship, researchers have evaluated the effects of N fertilizer practices on WUE. For maize fields to be productive and resource-use efficient, numerous researchers have proposed a compromise of management practices that optimize grain yield and WUE. These practices include only applying N when water is adequate [<a href="#B15">15</a>, <a href="#B16">16</a>], maintaining proper fertility based on tillage practices [<a href="#B16">16</a>] and applying proper amounts of irrigation at critical growth stages [<a href="#B15">15</a>, <a href="#B18">17</a>, <a href="#B19">18</a>].</p><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the interactive effects of two N fertilizer sources (UAN and AS), application rate, and deficit irrigation on maize early season vegetative growth, grain yield, NUE, and WUE. Our hypotheses for this trial are parallel to what previous researchers have documented in that the use of irrigation will increase not only the grain yield and NUE, but also the WUE. How efficient each fertilizer source will be for each system will be determined with the premise that the source that is more ammoniacally based will be more efficient regardless of system.</p><h4 id="sec2">2. Materials and Methods</h4><p>The experiment was conducted at two locations (Stillwater, OK, and Lake Carl Blackwell, OK) during the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. Basic early spring preplant soil nutrient testing results (0&#x2013;15&#x2009;cm) and site soil mapping unit descriptions are provided in Table <a target="_blank" href="tab1/">1</a>. If required, sites were fertilized prior to planting to 100 percent sufficient levels based on soil test P and K results and the fertilizer recommendations described in Zhang and Raun [<a href="#B20">19</a>]. This practice was conducted to ensure that N was the only limiting nutrient.</p><div class="fig" id="tab1"><div class="figgroupcaption"><a target="_blank" class="thumbnail" href="tab1/"><span><object type="image/svg+xml" data="../floats/247835/thumbnails/247835.tab1_th.svgz" name="tab1"/></span></a></div><div class="groupcaption"><b>Table 1: </b>Preplant surface (0&#x2013;15&#x2009;cm) chemical characteristics and soil classification of sites utilized in this study.</div></div><p>A split-block experimental design with three replications per site-year was employed to evaluate the effects of irrigation and N fertilizer source in this experiment. Irrigated or rain-fed treatments served as the main plot, while five N fertilizer treatments based upon N source and N rate served as the subplot. Ammonium sulfate (AS, 21-0-0) and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN, 28-0-0) N fertilizer sources were evaluated in this experiment. Both fertilizer sources were applied at N rates of 90 and 180&#x2009;kg&#x2009;N&#x2009;ha<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Fertilizer was broadcast applied and mechanically incorporated prior to planting. A complete list of the five N fertilizer treatments, which includes an unfertilized check, implemented to both irrigated and rain-fed plots, is provided in Table <a target="_blank" href="tab2/">2</a>. To ensure that the added sulfur associated with the AS fertilizer would not have an effect on treatments, preplant soil samples were analyzed for sulfate-sulfur content (Table <a target="_blank" href="tab1/">1</a>). The sulfate-sulfur soil test values were above sufficient levels described by the regional recommendations of Zhang and Raun [<a href="#B20">19</a>].</p><div class="fig" id="tab2"><div class="figgroupcaption"><a target="_blank" class="thumbnail" href="tab2/"><span><object type="image/svg+xml" data="../floats/247835/thumbnails/247835.tab2_th.svgz" name="tab2"/></span></a></div><div class="groupcaption"><b>Table 2: </b>Nitrogen fertilizer treatment structure applied to both irrigated and rain-fed plots in this study.</div></div><p>For all site-years, plot sizes were 3.1&#x2009;m wide by 6.2&#x2009;m long. Four rows spaced at 76&#x2009;cm apart were planted per plot and all measured observations were collected on the middle two rows. Field activities including planting dates, hybrids, seeding rates, N fertilizer application dates, irrigation totals, and harvest dates are provided in Table <a target="_blank" href="tab3/">3</a>. Planting took place in the spring using maize hybrids that are known to express improved drought tolerance. Seeding rates were based on best agronomic practices for the region. The type of irrigation used was surface drip irrigation. Though this is not an economically viable option for irrigation in maize production, it was used strictly for research purposes. The use of drip irrigation allowed for the accurate measurement and placement of applied water. Two strips of drip tape were placed through each plot between the first and second rows and between the third and fourth rows. The amount of irrigation water (mm) distributed over each plot was determined by measuring the liters of water applied over the given area.</p><div class="fig" id="tab3"><div class="figgroupcaption"><a target="_blank" class="thumbnail" href="tab3/"><span><object type="image/svg+xml" data="../floats/247835/thumbnails/247835.tab3_th.svgz" name="tab3"/></span></a></div><div class="groupcaption"><b>Table 3: </b>Field activities for the four site-years utilized in this study.</div></div><p>Potential differences in early vegetative growth/biomass accumulation were measured using the normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) values collected with a Greenseeker (Trimble, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) ground based, optical sensor.

Plot grain yields were adjusted for a standard moisture content of 155&#x2009;g&#x2009;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Grain subsamples were oven-dried and processed to pass a 140&#x2009;mesh screen and were analyzed for total N content using a dry combustion analyzer. The NUE was then calculated by employing the difference method described by Varvel and Peterson [<a href="#B22">25</a>] that utilizes the following equation:

					where grain N uptake for treated plots or the check plot was quantified by the percent N in the grain multiplied by the grain yield.</p><p/><p/><p>The WUE (kg&#x2009;ha<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x2009;mm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) was measured for both site locations during the 2013 growing season. It was calculated as the ratio of dry grain yield (kg&#x2009;ha<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) at 15.5 percent moisture to the seasonal water use expressed as ET. The ET was estimated using a modified water balance proposed by Heerman [<a href="#B23">26</a>] detailed in the following equation:

Discussion</h4><p>Deficit irrigation applied in the later vegetative and reproductive maize growth stages significantly increased grain yield and WUE. These results are what were to be expected.</p><p>Irrigation at times that have been deemed critical for optimum grain yield [<a href="#B5">5</a>] has aided in optimizing yield [<a href="#B6">6</a>, <a href="#B7">7</a>]. Though it is only statistically significant for one of the four site-years, deficit irrigation also increased the NUE of the maize crop. Increases in NUE were likely due to greater N uptake and grain yield response to N fertilization. These results are similar to what has been observed by other researchers [<a href="#B14">14</a>&#x2013;<a href="#B18">17</a>].</p><p>For three of the four site-years, rain-fed treatments had a greater yield response and increase in NUE for the AS treatments compared to the UAN treatments. This may be because of the more expansive root growth in the maize plant&#x2019;s attempt to acquire more soil moisture. The expansive root system would then have the ability to take up more of the immobile ammonium in the soil. Another desirable trait of ammoniacal N fertilizer sources in maize is that maize is able to take up ammonium during reproductive growth, whereas nitrate uptake is inhibited [<a href="#B9">9</a>, <a href="#B26">29</a>]. Urea ammonium nitrate can be an effective N fertilizer source if the potential loss mechanisms (leaching, volatilization, and denitrification) are minimized [<a href="#B12">12</a>]. The UAN treatments did outperform the AS treatments for the 2013 irrigated trials, but not the 2012 irrigated trials. This could be due to the fact that both 2013 sites had an above average rainfall for the region and, with adequate moisture early in the growing season, expansive root systems were not developed, which would have reduced ammonium acquisition from the soil. At Lake Carl Blackwell in 2013, the numerically lower yield response to UAN under irrigated conditions compared to the Stillwater site for that year and the lack of a numerical response to UAN for the rain-fed site could be due to potential N losses from the UAN. This site received the most rainfall of any site-year and we observed the topsoil to be saturated for a substantial amount of time prior to reproductive growth, thus leading to potential N losses via denitrification.</p><p>Little to no observable differences or trends in early season vegetative growth, as determined by collecting NDVI values, were present. However, with differences observed in grain yield and NUE between fertilizer treatments, there is the possibility that the inorganic N form (nitrate or ammonium) present in the soil later in the growing season affected grain yield and NUE.</p><p>To better optimize grain yield and NUE, the proper N fertilizer rate should be applied. The decrease in NUE values when the N fertilizer rate was increased from 90 to 180&#x2009;kg&#x2009;N&#x2009;ha<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> is typical for maize production and has been observed by others [<a href="#B8">8</a>, <a href="#B27">30</a>]. For irrigated treatments, linear relationships with grain yield and N fertilizer rate were usually observed for both UAN and AS. However, a few of the rain-fed and irrigated site-years displayed statistically significant quadratic trends. These trends in which there is either a decrease or no increase in grain yield with added N above 90&#x2009;kg&#x2009;N&#x2009;ha<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> point towards excess N being applied and producers should adjust N application rates accordingly. With just two fertilizer rates plus a check treatment being employed, accurately determining an agronomic optimum preplant N fertilizer rate with the data from this trial would not be precise. However, producers should attempt to utilize some forms of a grain yield approach in making a preplant only N fertilizer rate recommendation or use regional N response trials from similar soil types under irrigation or rain-fed conditions.</p><p>Irrigated maize WUE values reportedly range from approximately 2 to 40&#x2009;kg&#x2009;ha<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x2009;mm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> [<a href="#B28">31</a>]. Irrigated WUE values observed in this experiment fell within this range. Variability in WUE values among treatments and growing seasons is to be expected. Zwart and Bastiaanssen [<a href="#B28">31</a>] reported climate, water management, and soil fertility, all of which were evaluated in this trial and have the potential to give rise to the variability of WUE in maize. The main and interactive effects determined to be significant from the analysis of variance and single degree-of-freedom contrast results were similar for grain yield and WUE. This likely could be due to the manner in which WUE was calculated for this experiment, which involves the ratio of grain yield to the measured ET. One variable employed for deriving the ET was to measure the change in profile soil moisture prior to planting and immediately after harvest. Pre- and postharvest soil profile samples revealed no differences in the soil profile content between treatments (data not reported). The July and August months in the Southern Great Plains can be extremely hot and dry and likely much of the soil profile moisture was lost to evaporation and some transpiration during the grain dry-down period after irrigation had ceased. If no differences were observed in ET between fertilizer treatments within irrigated or rain-fed plots, then one can conclude that the differences in WUE would be dictated by the differences in grain yield.</p><h4 id="sec5">5. Conclusions</h4><p>In conclusion, deficit irrigation during late vegetative and reproductive growth stages increased grain yield, NUE, and WUE. With three of the four rain-fed site-years reporting increases in grain yield and NUE, we would recommend that a pure ammoniacal N fertilizer source be applied if a preplant only N fertilizer application is to be utilized. If irrigation water is available, the N source is not as critical. However, the producer should be cognizant of the potential N loss mechanisms (leaching, volatilization, and denitrification) of N fertilizer sources like UAN. Lastly, if producers are going to utilize a preplant only fertilizer N application for maize cultivated on the Southern Great Plains, they should accordingly adjust N fertilizer rates based on a reasonable irrigated or rain-fed yield goal or regional N response trials.</p><h4 id="Abbreviations">Abbreviations</h4><table class="gloss-abbr"><tr><td>AS: </td><td>Ammonium sulfate</td></tr><tr><td>ET: </td><td>Evapotranspiration</td></tr><tr><td>NUE: </td><td>Nitrogen use efficiency</td></tr><tr><td>NDVI: </td><td>Normalized difference vegetation index</td></tr><tr><td>PET: </td><td>Potential evapotranspiration</td></tr><tr><td>UAN: </td><td>Urea ammonium nitrate</td></tr><tr><td>WUE: </td><td>Water use efficiency.</td></tr></table><h4>Disclosure</h4><p>The mention of any trademarked product or equipment utilized in this experiment was for research purposes only and does not act as an endorsement by Oklahoma State University.</p><h4>Conflict of Interests</h4><p>The authors and Oklahoma State University have no direct financial relation with any of the named manufacturers; thus, the authors declare there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</p><h4>Acknowledgments</h4><p>The authors would like to thank the Oklahoma Soil Fertility Research and Education Advisory Board for their funding of this research project and their continued financial support of soil fertility research at Oklahoma State University.</p></div></div><div class="xml-content"><h4>References</h4>
