<abstract>
<p>We describe a new species of fanged frog (<italic>Limnonectes larvaepartus</italic>) that is unique among anurans in having both internal fertilization and birth of tadpoles. The new species is endemic to Sulawesi Island, Indonesia. This is the fourth valid species of <italic>Limnonectes</italic> described from Sulawesi despite that the radiation includes at least 15 species and possibly many more. Fewer than a dozen of the 6455 species of frogs in the world are known to have internal fertilization, and of these, all but the new species either deposit fertilized eggs or give birth to froglets.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Indonesian island of Sulawesi in central Indonesia is home to a largely unstudied radiation of fanged frogs in the genus <italic>Limnonectes</italic> Fitzinger, 1843 (Anura: Dicroglossidae Anderson, 1871). To date, only three species are recognized from Sulawesi, but at least 15 species occur on the island <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Emerson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Evans1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Setiadi1">[3]</xref>. It was recently proposed that Sulawesi fanged frogs represent an adaptive radiation based on patterns of morphological diversification among co-distributed species, and correspondence of morphological features (body size, webbing) with habitat utilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Setiadi1">[3]</xref>. Adult body size ranges from ∼2 g to more than 900 g in members of the Sulawesi assemblage, with large-bodied species found in close association with fast moving rivers, and small-bodied species occupying more terrestrial niches in forest leaf-litter and on the banks of slow moving streams. Iskandar and Tjan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Iskandar1">[4]</xref> first documented that there are multiple undescribed species of <italic>Limnonectes</italic> on Sulawesi, and indicated that one of the constituent species utilizes an unusual ovoviviparous reproductive strategy. Here we describe that species, and provide additional details on its reproductive mode.</p>
<p>Anurans exhibit tremendous diversity in mode of reproduction. Not only have there been many independent origins of direct development, the condition in which a free-living tadpole stage is bypassed and froglets emerge from the egg capsules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Wake1">[5]</xref>, but a bewildering array of mechanisms has evolved wherein parents care for their developing offspring. Examples of parental care include guarding of terrestrial eggs, transport of tadpoles on the back following hatching, carrying developing eggs in pouches or depressions on the back and flanks, males carrying developing tadpoles in the vocal sac, and even the now-extinct species of gastric brooding frogs in which the female carried her developing tadpoles in her stomach (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Haddad1">[6]</xref> for a summary). Despite this extreme reproductive diversity, internal fertilization has evolved only a few times among the 6455 known species of anurans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-AmphibiaWeb1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-McDiarmid1">[8]</xref>. Only the African bufonid genera <italic>Nectophrynoides</italic> and <italic>Nimbaphrynoides</italic> and the now extinct Puerto Rican species, <italic>Eleutherodactylus jasperi</italic>, are documented to combine internal fertilization with egg retention and subsequent birth of froglets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Wells1">[9]</xref>. To this group, we can now add a species of Sulawesi fanged frog in the genus <italic>Limnonectes</italic> with internal fertilization and live birth of tadpoles, a reproductive mode that is unique among anurans.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We analyzed more than 100 specimens representing the new species from 23 localities on the island of Sulawesi. This study was conducted under an approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol issued to JAM by the University of California at Berkeley (Protocol #R279). Fieldwork conducted in Indonesia was undertaken under research permits issued by LIPI and RISTEK, with specimen exportation authorized under permits or loans issued by LIPI, the Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense, and Pusat Studi Biologi. Specimens were captured by hand in the field, sacrificed via emersion in an aqueous solution of MS-222 (tricaine methane sulfonate) buffered to neutral pH, and prepared as formalin-fixed specimens deposited primarily in the Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense (the national museum of Indonesia) or Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at UC Berkeley. As part of a comprehensive study of Sulawesi <italic>Limnonectes</italic> diversification, we obtained morphometric data for the full Sulawesi assemblage. Sex was determined by inspection of gonads. The following measurements were made to the nearest 0.1 mm using digital calipers: snout-vent length (SVL) – from cloaca to tip of snout; head width (HW) – widest distance between posterior end of lower jaw; head length (HL) – from posterior end of lower jaw to tip of snout; femur length (FE) – from cloaca to distal end of femur; tibia length (TI) – from knee to distal end of tibia; foot length (FL) – from distal end of tibia-fibula to tip of 4th toe; inner metatarsal tubercle (IM); humerus length (UA) – from proximal end of upper arm to elbow; lower arm length (LA) – from elbow joint to base of middle palmar tubercle; hand length (HA) – from lower border of middle tubercle to distal tip of third finger; snout length (SL) – from bony border of eye socket to tip of snout; snout width at eye level (SWE); snout width at nostril level (SWN); eye diameter (EY) – outer diameter, measured from bones bordering eye; interorbital distance (IO) – distance between orbits ( =  width of frontoparietal bones); eye-tympanum distance (ET); eye-narial distance (EN) – eye socket border to posterior border of nostril; Internarial distance (IN) – shortest distance between nostrils; nostril to tip of snout (NT); tympanum diameter (TY); odontoid process length (OP) –length of fang-like odontoid process of lower jaw; tibia diameter measured at its widest point (TD).

<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>Prior workers have recognized substantial species diversity in the genus <italic>Limnonectes</italic> on Sulawesi. However, diagnosing many of these lineages on the basis of morphology is challenging, and several authors have instead opted to apply names to Sulawesi specimens representing species from outside Sulawesi. Consequently, the following names have all been incorrectly applied to Sulawesi populations: the Lesser Sundas species (type locality: Flores Island) <italic>L. dammermani</italic> (Mertens, 1927), the Bornean species <italic>L. finchii</italic> (Inger, 1966), the Mollucan species (type locality: Ambon) <italic>L. grunniens</italic> (Daudin, 1801), and the Philippine taxa <italic>L. leytensis</italic> (Boettger, 1893), <italic>L. magnus</italic> (Stejneger, 1909), and <italic>L. palavanensis</italic> (Boulenger, 1894). These names should not be applied to Sulawesi populations, as was verified phylogenetically for several of these taxa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Setiadi1">[3]</xref>. Only four Sulawesi species have been described: <italic>L. arathooni</italic> (Smith, 1927), <italic>L. heinrichi</italic> (Ahl, 1933), <italic>L. modestus</italic> (Boulenger, 1882), and <italic>L. microtympanum</italic> (van Kampen, 1909). However, we will show elsewhere that <italic>L. heinrichi</italic> is a junior synonym of <italic>L. modestus</italic> and the species complex that we have referred to previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Evans1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Setiadi1">[3]</xref> as <italic>L. modestus</italic> remains undescribed – thus, at present there are but three valid described species of Sulawesi <italic>Limnonectes</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Limnonectes larvaepartus</italic> can be distinguished from all other described species of <italic>Limnonectes</italic> by its reproductive mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115884-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). It can be further differentiated from all described Sulawesi species by its combination of body size (mean male SVL = 37.4; female SVL = 40.2 mm), coloration, tympanum size, and degree of hind foot webbing, as well as on the basis of phylogenetic placement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115884-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). <italic>Limnonectes arathooni</italic> is endemic to Sulawesi's Southwestern (SW) Peninsula south of the Tempe Depression, and thus does not occur within the range of <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic>. It is similar in size to the new species (male SVL = 36.6 mm, females = 39.6 mm), but differs in having substantially reduced webbing (extending to penultimate phalange of fourth toe vs. to toe disc), in lacking fine granular dorsal tubercles, and in having melanic spots above the forelimb insertion, a fine ridge extending posteriorly behind each eye, and an alternative derived reproductive mode in which males guard clutches of terrestrial eggs that hatch into tadpoles that then make their own way to an adjacent stream by sliding down steep stream-side embankments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Brown1">[14]</xref>. <italic>Limnonectes microtympanum</italic>, like <italic>L. arathooni</italic>, is restricted to the SW Peninsula south of the Tempe Depression, and thus does not overlap in geographical range with <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic>. <italic>Limnonectes microtympanum</italic> is moderately large (male SVL = 78.4; female SVL = 72.4 mm), and thus much larger than the new species. <italic>Limnonectes microtympanum</italic> also differs from the new species in having proportionally smaller tympana (TY/SVL = 0.05<underline>+</underline>0.01 in males, 0.06<underline>+</underline>0.01 in females versus 0.08<underline>+</underline>0.01 in both sexes in <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic>). The new species occurs in broad sympatry with <italic>L. modestus</italic>, which is a moderate sized (male SVL = 70.2 mm; female SVL = 64.0 mm) inhabitant of fast-moving streams and substantially larger than <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic>. Like <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic>, <italic>L. modestus</italic> has nearly complete hindfoot webbing (slightly more extensive in <italic>L. modestus</italic> than in <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic> but reaching the toe disc in both species), a dusky throat with melanic pigments extending onto the pectoral region (in a clear wedge shape in <italic>L. modestus</italic>, more randomly distributed in <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic>), and skin with extensive fine granular tubercles. <italic>Limnonectes modestus</italic> also exhibits a derived reproductive mode involving production of a relatively small number of large (10 mm diameter) eggs that are deposited along the edge of fast moving streams.</p>

<title>Coloration</title>
<p>The dorsal coloration is highly variable, typically brownish-grey, but can be darker brown on the dorsolateral region, and some individuals are reddish-brown or golden-tan (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115884-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). ∼23% of specimens have a bold mid-dorsal stripe. The venter is either yellowish or cream colored, with the upper end of the tibia usually bearing a prominent dark spot. A light bar is often present in the interorbital region, and the coloration of the snout to interorbital region may be lighter than the remainder of the dorsum. The tympanum is often masked in black leaving only the lower rim sharing the predominant body coloration. The gular region is usually darker in males and may have a finely mottled wedge-shaped melanic patch. The dorsal half of the iris is golden-orange in coloration in at least some individuals (we do not know of exceptions, but have not documented iris coloration for most specimens).</p>

<title>Eggs and tadpoles</title>
<p>Females produce ∼100 non-pigmented eggs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Kusrini1">[15]</xref>), though the most we have observed is 55, which possibly represents the contents of just one oviduct. The eggs lack a jelly-coat and reach at least ∼3 mm in diameter. These eggs develop within the oviducts into pigmented tadpoles that reach at least Gosner stage 35 prior to parturition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Gosner1">[16]</xref> for staging). The gut is initially provisioned with substantial yolk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115884-g002">Fig. 2<italic>b</italic></xref>), and developing tadpoles prematurely removed from the oviducts at approximately stage 21 progressed to approximately stage 25 over the course of two weeks in a water bottle without supplemental food, suggesting plasticity in terms of the timing of parturition.

<title>Natural history</title>
<p><italic>Limnonectes larvaepartus</italic> occurs in natural and disturbed forest habitats of Sulawesi, generally in sympatry with at least one, and sometimes as many as five other <italic>Limnonectes</italic> species. In the western Central Core of Sulawesi, we have always found <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic> living in sympatry with a much larger species that has been referred to in the literature as <italic>L.</italic> sp. <italic>D</italic> (2,3). Whereas <italic>L.</italic> sp. <italic>D</italic> is generally found on rocks in fast-moving streams or within a meter of water on the banks of fast-flowing streams, <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic> is usually found further from the stream (2–10 meters from water) on rocky substrates, in leaf-litter, or secluded in grassy vegetation. Because we have observed that <italic>L.</italic> sp. <italic>D</italic> predates other frogs, including other <italic>Limonectes</italic>, it is possible that <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic> avoids large streams in response to predation pressure from larger <italic>Limnonectes</italic> species. Male <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic> typically call from the margins of seeps, puddles, or small pools away from the main stream. Notably, we have found many males calling from small pools that were already inhabited by <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic> tadpoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115884-g002">Fig. 2<italic>c</italic></xref>), with as many as three size-classes of tadpoles represented. It is unclear whether some or all of the observed tadpoles were sired by the accompanying male. We have furthermore collected at least one pregnant female from a small stream-side puddle already inhabited by tadpoles of two size classes, again suggesting the possibility that individual pools may be visited repeatedly by the same adult males and females during the reproductive season.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s4">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We first became aware of the unusual reproductive mode of <italic>Limnonectes larvaepartus</italic> while conducting fieldwork on Sulawesi. In several instances, we discovered tadpoles in the oviducts while preparing specimens. In each case, having sacrificed frogs for preparation, the abdominal wall was observed to quiver, and incision resulted in living tadpoles emerging from the opening (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115884.s001">S1 Movie</xref>). On one occasion, a gravid female gave birth to tadpoles in-hand at the moment of capture. On four other occasions, field-collected <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic> in our possession gave birth to tadpoles while being held individually in collecting bags. In total, we have either observed tadpoles in the oviducts or direct-birth of tadpoles on 19 occasions.</p>
<p>Because we have not witnessed natural birth of tadpoles in free-living frogs, two possible alternative reproductive modes are possible for this species. <italic>Limnonectes larvaepartus</italic> reproduction may simply reflect what we have observed in the hand – direct birth of tadpoles. Alternatively, this species may be capable of retaining developing young in the oviducts through metamorphosis with subsequent birth of froglets, as is the case for <italic>Eleutherodactylus jasperi</italic> and members of the African bufonid genera <italic>Nectophrynoides</italic> and <italic>Nimbaphrynoides</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Wells1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Wake2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Wake3">[18]</xref>. The latter mode seems unlikely for several reasons. First, we have collected 19 pregnant individuals carrying tadpoles in the oviducts but none carrying froglets. These 19 females were collected across different months, years, and localities. Second, we have observed and collected at least four clutches of free-living <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic> tadpoles in small pools of water on the margins of streams, with each of these samples exhibiting two or three size classes and thus possibly representing multiple clutches. Three of these clutches were accompanied by males, some of which were calling, and one was found in association with the gravid female that gave birth to 55 tadpoles (some in the hand of JAM, others subsequently deposited in a collecting bag). Finally, although adaptive plasticity has been demonstrated for many frog species, whereby tadpoles or froglets are capable of hatching from their eggs prematurely when attacked by predators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Warkentin1">[19]</xref>, this has only been documented for a single direct-developer, <italic>Eleutherodactylus coqui</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Buckley1">[20]</xref>. In the case of <italic>E. coqui</italic>, the capacity for early hatching commenced at stages 13 or 14, whereas normal hatching occurred at stage 15 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Townsend1">[21]</xref> for staging). Thus, <italic>E. coqui</italic> were capable of premature hatching only as froglets, with toe pads and eyelids present but before the tail was completely resorbed, a stage much later than would be required by <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic> if it were simultaneously capable of hatching as either a tadpole or full-term froglet. Most direct-developers, as well as the few frog species that give birth to froglets, pass through the tadpole stage in a form poorly suited for free-living. In many such species, the tadpole has a broad, highly vascularized ‘respiratory tail’ specialized for intra-egg or intra-oviductal gas exchange rather than for swimming, as is the case for <italic>Eleutherodactylus jasperi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Wake2">[17]</xref>, and may lack mouthparts and functional gills <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Lutz1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Lynn1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Thibaudeau1">[24]</xref>. In others, the tail remains rudimentary and limb buds appear early in development such that a typical tadpole phenotype never occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Lutz1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Lynn1">[23]</xref>. Given these observations, it appears unlikely that any one species would be characterized by the combination of (1) internal fertilization, (2) complete metamorphosis within the oviducts and live-birth in the form of froglets, as well as (3) an oviductal tadpole stage that is capable of premature birth and free-living. Although we think that <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic> is much more likely to give birth to tadpoles as its sole mode of reproduction as opposed to exhibiting adaptive plasticity allowing for birth of either tadpoles or froglets depending on the circumstances confronting the frog, we note that either condition would be unique among Anura. In either case, <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic> requires internal fertilization, which is, itself, extremely rare among anurans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-McDiarmid1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Duellman1">[25]</xref>. The mechanism by which internal fertilization takes place is unknown, and there is no obvious intromittent organ present to facilitate sperm transfer. If <italic>L. larvaepartus</italic> reproduction always involves birth of tadpoles, it is likely that they are ovoviparous given that the tadpoles are well provisioned with yolk and appear fully capable of developing without nutrient transfer from the mother. Prior to parturition, the tadpoles have well-developed tails and pigmentation, and well developed mouthparts. Given this morphology, it is unlikely that these tadpoles are endotrophic (never feed before metamorphosing into froglets). It is more likely that the tadpoles are born after exhausting their yolk supply, and are subsequently self-feeding prior to metamorphosis. Nevertheless, it is clear that much remains to be learned about this unusual frog, the discovery of which brings to light yet another axis of diversity characterizing the remarkable Sulawesi fanged frog adaptive radiation.</p>
