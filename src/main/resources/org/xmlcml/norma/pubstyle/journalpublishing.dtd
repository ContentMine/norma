<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--

     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.3                       (DAL/BTU) v2.3 (2007-02-02)
     
     Enhancement Release (2.3) following the Working Group meetings 
     of Oct-Nov/2006-Jan/2007. No backward-incompatible changes.
     Archiving loosened even more. New structures for all the DTDs. 
     
20. FLOATS WRAPPER - Added new element <floats-wrap> to both of the
     models for article (article-short and article-full) and the model
     for sub-article. This new element, which follows the <back> 
     element, is a  just a wrapper to hold the floating objects that 
     occur anywhere in the article. Some publishers like to 
     collect all the "floating objects" (figures, tables, text boxes, 
     graphics, etc.) together at the end of the document rather than 
     interspersing them throughout the parts of the article where 
     they are referenced. 
          
 19. DTD VERSION ATTRIBUTE - Fixed attribute value changed from "2.2" 
     to "2.3" to reflect latest version of DTD
     
 18. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.2                       (DAL/BTU) v2.2 (2006-04-30)
     
     Backwards-compatible changes to meet operational needs.
     Typical changes include adding attribute values and making 
     required elements optional.
          
 17. DTD VERSION ATTRIBUTE - Fixed attribute value changed from "2.1" 
     to "2.2" to reflect latest version of DTD

 16. RESPONSE TYPE ATTRIBUTE - Only the comment has changed to reflect
     the usage. First, the use of the attribute is no longer
     discouraged. Second, there are a few suggested values.
          
 15. SUB-ARTICLE/RESPONSE METADATA
     a. Added new element <front-stub> as an alternative to the 
     typical <front> metadata inside a  <sub-article>, so that not 
     as much metadata is replicated between the article and 
     sub-article. For example, a <sub-article> that uses a
     <front-stub> will inherit all of its <journal-meta> from the
     journal meta of the associated article.
     
     b. Changed the model for %article-short-model; (which is used
        only for <response> to also use <front-stub>
          
 14. ID ATTRIBUTES- Added <sub-article> and <response> through
     their attribute Parameter Entities
          
 13. SIGNATURE BLOCK- Added to the end of article <body>
          
 12. ARTICLE TYPES ATTRIBUTE - Added new values to "article-types":
      - collection
      - dissertation
      - partial-retraction
      - rapid-communication
      - reprint
      - translation
  
 11. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.1                       (DAL/BTU) v2.1 (2005-06-30)
          
     Changed to MathML 2.0 and MathML 2.0 Character Sets
     Added new material requested by the online list     

 10. Modified Module of Modules to include new MathML 2.0 DTD
     and modified xmlspecchars.ent that includes new MathML Character
     sets which match Unicode 4.0. 

     Implementor Alert: New directory structure for the character
     sets was also adopted, to match the new MathML directories.

     Implementor Alert: New directory structure for the character
     sets was also adopted, to match the new MathML directories.
     There are now 3 character set directories:
            - iso8879 (from SGML used in MathML)
            - iso9573-13 (from ISO Tech Rpt used in MathML)
            - xmlchars (from SGML not used in MathML)

  9. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202", modified the
     fpis of the updated modules (both publishing custom modules 
     and the Suite modules), and changed the "dtd-version" fixed 
     attribute to reference latest version of DTD (version "2.1").

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                  (Beck/DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     
     Minor tweaks before public release. Decision was made not to
     change release number

  8. FRONT MODEL - Added -%front-back.class;, thereby adding
     optional <notes> to Front Matter

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-07-30)
          
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  7. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A CONTENT MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
     the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now.
     Added parentheses to Parameter Entity and removed them 
     from the Element Declarations:
     -  %article-short-model; 
     -  %article-full-model;
     -  %front-model;
     -  %body-model;
     -  %back-model;
      
  6. DOC-BACK-MATTER-ELEMENTS/DOC-BACK-MATTER-MIX 
     a. Reparameterized content for classing reasons. No model change.
     b. Renamed to -%doc-back-matter-mix; 
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Names ending in "-elements" saved for the particular mixes
        that will be added to #PCDATA for a particular element,
     
  5. REMODULARIZATION - Replaced the previous single Publishing
     customization module (journalpubcustomize.ent) with the
     following single-function customization modules:
     - journalpubcustom-modules.ent (declare all the Publishing-
          DTD-specific modules)
     - journalpubcustom-classes.ent (Publishing class over-rides)
     - journalpubcustom-mix.ent (Publishing mix over-rides)
     - journalpubcustom-models.ent (Publishing model over-rides)
     - nlm-citation.ent (just the NLM Citation element, which is
         the only new element created by the Publishing DTD)

  4. NEW VERSION - Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202" 
     on this module and the customization and module-of-modules 
     modules. New customization module for new classing structures.
     Changed fixed DTD version number attribute to "2.0"

     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)                                                                

  3. Updated public identifier to "v1.1 20031101"

  2. Changed parameter entity %dtd-version; to reference latest
     version of DTD (version 1.1)

  1. Updated public identifiers for modules.ent and 
     archivecustomize.ent to reflect modules' modification.
     Rationale: To call updated modules.
                                                                   -->

<!-- MODULAR DTD LIBRARY
                        A set of journal archiving and interchange 
                        DTD modules was written as the basis for 
                        publishing, interchange, and repository 
                        DTDs, with the intention that DTDs for 
                        specific purposes, such as this Publishing 
                        DTD, would be developed based on them.
                        
                        This publishing DTD has been optimized for 
                        the creation of new journal articles. This 
                        means that it is far smaller (fewer elements,
                        and fewer choices in many contexts) than was
                        the interchange DTD. Where in the interchange
                        DTD there may have been several ways to 
                        express the same information, only one is 
                        provided for authoring. It was not the 
                        intention to limit the expressive power 
                        licensed by the DTD, but rather to limit the 
                        meaningless choices needed in a full 
                        archiving and interchange DTD that make 
                        conversion from a wide variety of formats as 
                        easy as possible.               
                        
                        This Publishing DTD has been developed from
                        the Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite
                        modules, in the approved manner, making 
                        changes to the declarations in those modules 
                        by overriding Parameter Entity defined in
                        the over-rise (customization) modules:   
                           %journalpubcustom-classes.ent;
                           %journalpubcustom-mixes.ent;
                           %journalpubcustom-models.ent;
                        which are all declared in the module:
                           %journalpubcustom-modules.ent;
                        Additional Publishing-DTD-Specific material
                        is defined in the module(s):
                           %nlmcitation.ent;
                        No changes to any of the original Archiving 
                        and Interchange Suite modules are required 
                        in order to use this DTD.                  -->

<!-- THE MANY ROADS NOT TAKEN
                        In the interest of getting a version of this
                        DTD into production as quickly as practical,
                        several structures and functions that might
                        be appropriately included have been delayed 
                        until a future version of this DTD. Such 
                        components include:
                          - Questions and Answers (These may be 
                              modeled with the current DTDs by using 
                              paragraphs and lists)
                          - Continuing Medical Education material
                             (which frequently contains questions 
                             and answers)
                          - Forms and fill-in-the-blank
                          - Conflict of Interest statements and
                              Financial Disclosure (May be modeled
                              as paragraphs or footnotes)
                          - Electronic and Digital Rights Management
                          - Advertising included in the journal:

                        ancillary information such as a glossary or
                        appendix, and (the least common) a
                        response, that is a commentary on the
                        article itself.                            -->

                        Which version of the DTD does this article
                        use? The value is a #FIXED attribute, so
                        the entire attribute definition is defined
                        in a Parameter Entity, so the next version
                        of the DTD can use a different #FIXED value.
             xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
                        element is expressed.  Recommended best 
                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiations such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"

                        explicitly set themselves with their own
                        "xml:lang" attribute.

                        MathML modules. These xmlns are called
                        here because certain older tools will not
                        work properly with namespaces unless they
                        are declared on the top level element.

                        response is included in the same XML package 
                        as the original article, and thus attached 
                        at the end of the article proper.
                        Authoring Note: Frequently a reply or
                        response is an article in its own right, not
                        included as part of the original article.
                        Such an article could use the 
                        <related-article> element in the article 
                        metadata to record the metadata for the 
                        original article.     
                        Conversion Note: This construction can also
                        be used for the pathological case, rarely
                        seen, in which several responses to an 
                        article are lumped together into a single
                        container which is not the original article,
                        merely a collection of responses. In one
                        example we examined, the first two responses
                        were to an original article which was else-
                        where and the third response was a response
                        to the first two responses.                -->

                        What kind of response is this?
                        Note: This does NOT define the kind of
                        article on which the response is commenting,
                        it is metadata for the response itself.
                        Suggested values include: 
                         addendum    Adds additional information or 
                                     clarification to the parent

                         discussion  Discussion related to a specific
                                     issue described in the parent
                                     article
                         reply       Reply to the parent article.
                                     This is the most commonly used
                                     value.
             xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
                        element is expressed.  Recommended best 
                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiations such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
                        (United States English).
                        Processing and Conversion Note: All other
                        xml:lang attributes within the article
                        inherit the value set on <article> unless
                        explicitly set themselves with their own
                        "xml:lang" attribute.                      -->
