It is crucial to understand how habitat alteration through forest management (e.g. clearcutting) affects animal populations, particularly with unknown future conditions (e.g. climate change). In Sweden, brown bears (<italic>Ursus arctos</italic>) forage on carpenter ants (<italic>Camponotus herculeanus</italic>) during summer, and may select for this food source within clearcuts. To assess carpenter ant occurrence and brown bear selection of carpenter ants, we sampled 6999 coarse woody debris (CWD) items within 1019 plots, of which 902 were within clearcuts (forests &#x02a7d;30&#x000a0;years of age) and 117 plots outside clearcuts (forests &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;years of age). We related various CWD and site characteristics to the presence or absence of carpenter ant galleries (nests) and bear foraging sign at three spatial scales: the CWD, plot, and clearcut scale. We tested whether both absolute and relative counts (the latter controlling for the number of CWD items) of galleries and bear sign in plots were higher inside or outside clearcuts. Absolute counts were higher inside than outside clearcuts for galleries (mean counts; inside: 1.8, outside: 0.8). CWD was also higher inside (mean: 6.8) than outside clearcuts (mean: 4.0). However, even after controlling for more CWD inside clearcuts, relative counts were higher inside than outside clearcuts for both galleries (mean counts; inside: 0.3, outside: 0.2) and bear sign (mean counts; inside: 0.03, outside: 0.01). Variables at the CWD scale best explained gallery and bear sign presence than variables at the plot or clearcut level, but bear selection was influenced by clearcut age. CWD circumference was important for both carpenter ant and bear sign presence. CWD hardness was most important for carpenter ant selection. However, the most important predictor for bear sign was the presence or absence of carpenter ant galleries. Bears had a high foraging &#x0201c;success&#x0201d; rate (&#x02a7e;88%) in foraging CWD where galleries also occurred, which was assessed by summing CWD items with the concurrence of bear sign and galleries, divided by the sum of all CWD with bear sign. Clearcuts appeared to increase the occurrence of a relatively important summer food item, the carpenter ant, on Swedish managed forests for the brown bear. However, the potential benefit of this increase can only be determined from a better understanding of the seasonal and interannual variation of the availability and use of other important brown bear food items, berries (e.g. <italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic> and <italic>Empetrum</italic> spp.), as well as other primary needs for bears (e.g. secure habitat and denning habitat), within the landscape mosaic of managed forests.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Brown bear</kwd><kwd><italic>Camponotus herculeanus</italic></kwd><kwd>Clearcuts</kwd><kwd>Coarse woody debris</kwd><kwd>Resource selection</kwd><kwd><italic>Ursus arctos</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Management of forest stands for production in the boreal region of Scandinavia has resulted in the alteration of stand characteristics and composition, nutrient cycles, and fire disturbance regimes (e.g. <xref rid="b0395 b0110 b0250" ref-type="bibr">Zackrisson, 1977; Esseen et al., 1997; &#x000d6;stlund et al., 1997</xref>). Clearcutting, or complete logging of areas, is commonly used in the boreal landscape by commercial forestry and may be viewed as an anthropogenic replacement for, or emulation of, fire disturbance (e.g. <xref rid="b0190 b0255" ref-type="bibr">McRae et al., 2001; Paillet et al., 2010</xref>), but not without limitation and/or criticism in implementation (e.g. <xref rid="b0020 b0330" ref-type="bibr">Bergeron et al., 2002; Seymour et al., 2002</xref>). The response by wildlife to clearcuts varies among species (e.g. <xref rid="b0265 b0340 b0335" ref-type="bibr">Potvin et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1999; Simon et al., 2002</xref>); some species obtain benefits such as increased cover, increased browse, and increased predation opportunities (e.g. <xref rid="b0040 b0205 b0125" ref-type="bibr">Carey and Harrington, 2001; Newbury et al., 2007; Hebblewhite et al., 2009</xref>), whereas clearcuts can negatively influence others (e.g. direct loss of habitat, decreased reproductive success, increased predation) (e.g. <xref rid="b0170 b0085 b0065" ref-type="bibr">Lomolino and Creighton, 1996; Deng and Gao, 2005; Courbin et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, a species can incur both benefits and disadvantages in response to clearcuts, e.g., caribou (<italic>Rangifer tarandus</italic>) may obtain increased forage, but this can become outweighed by the disadvantage of increased predation risk (<xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Leclerc et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Also, within species, there is variable use of clearcuts among individuals and/or populations. Whereas previous research in North America has shown that brown bears (<italic>Ursus arctos</italic>) avoid clearcuts (<xref rid="b0400 b0180" ref-type="bibr">Zager et al., 1983; McLellan and Hovey, 2001</xref>), they have more recently been shown to select them (<xref rid="b0215 b0195 b0165" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2004a; Moe et al., 2007; Linke et al., 2013</xref>) in both North America and Sweden. Clearcut selection appears to be influenced by human activity (e.g. <xref rid="b0385 b0380 b0045" ref-type="bibr">Wielgus et al., 2002; Wielgus and Vernier, 2003; Ciarniello et al., 2007</xref>) and could also be influenced by the social organization of brown bears (<xref rid="b0360 b0100" ref-type="bibr">Steyaert et al., 2013; Elfstr&#x000f6;m et al., 2014</xref>). In Sweden, brown bears mainly select clearcuts during spring and during the crepuscular hours, likely owing to their foraging on ants (especially carpenter ants [<italic>Camponotus herculeanus</italic>]) (<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Ciarniello et al., 2014</xref>), while avoiding encounters with humans (<xref rid="b0195 b0245" ref-type="bibr">Moe et al., 2007; Ordiz et al., 2014</xref>). Carpenter ants, which inhabit live and especially dead wood within cut out galleries (altogether composing the nest), are a preferred food source for brown bears in Sweden (<xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">Swenson et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Ant/termite-eating by mammals has been observed among at least 216 species, covering 43 families, wherein only approximately 22 are considered specialists (i.e. &#x0003e;90% of diet consists of ants and/or termites) (<xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">Redford, 1987</xref>), such as the giant anteater (<italic>Myrmecophaga tridactyla</italic>), the echidna (<italic>Tachyglossus aculeatus</italic>), and the aardvark (<italic>Orycteropus afer</italic>) (e.g. <xref rid="b0280 b0005 b0370" ref-type="bibr">Redford, 1986; Abensperg-Traun and Boer, 1992; Taylor et al., 2002</xref>, respectively). Most mammalian species that feed on ants/termites appear to be opportunistic myrmecophages (<xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Delsuc et al., 2014</xref>). Aside from a more specialized form in sloth bears (<italic>Melursus ursinus</italic>) and altogether absence in polar bears (<italic>Ursus maritimus</italic>) (<xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 1997</xref>), opportunistic myrmecophagy appears to be common place for bear species. It has been commonly described for American black bears (<italic>Ursus americanus</italic>) (e.g. <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Noyce et al., 1997</xref>), Asiatic black bears (<italic>Ursus thibetanus</italic>) (e.g. <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref>), and brown bears (e.g. <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Mattson, 2001</xref>). When myrmecophagy has been described for bear species, most studies deal with the use of ants by bears relative to their availability, without regard to potential factors determining ant availability.</p><p><xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">Sanders (1970)</xref> asserted that carpenter ants nests are limited by the number of available potential nesting sites (i.e., coarse woody debris; CWD). Although intensive forest management has been linked to less CWD than otherwise found in unmanaged forests (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Fridman and Walheim, 2000</xref>), the opening of the forest structure (e.g. increased light) favors carpenter ant colonization (<xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Punttila et al., 1991</xref>). In order to better manage for biodiversity and meet policy, Swedish forest companies have implemented silviculture treatments, including the partial retention of snags, logs, and/or stumps (i.e. CWD) following clearcuts (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Fridman and Walheim, 2000</xref>; Anders Fr&#x000e4;&#x000e4;s, personal communication, 2010), which most likely provide nesting habitat for carpenter ants.</p><p>Few studies of brown bear food resources in human-modified landscapes have recognized the need to understand the determinants of resource availability, not just use (<xref rid="b0215 b0220" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2004a; Nielsen et al., 2004b</xref>). Furthermore, wildlife select habitats and their resources hierarchically (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Johnson, 1980</xref>). Therefore, the choice of scale in determining both resource availability and resource selection is important (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Boyce, 2006</xref>), because influential processes may be masked or inflated, due to an arbitrary or limited scope on scaling.</p><p>The aim of this study was to understand how forest management (i.e. clearcut characteristics) may influence brown bear utilization of a food resource (carpenter ants), and which variables may influence the availability of that food source. Predictor variables spanned three spatial scales: CWD item, plot and clearcut scales, whereas the response variable remained fixed to the CWD scale (i.e., binary presence-absence). Therefore, we explored which environmental variables best explained the presence-absence of carpenter ants in CWD and the selection of CWD by brown bears within a hierarchical framework of predictors. We also tested whether clearcuts provided a higher availability of carpenter ants and whether they had higher bear selection of CWD than surrounding forested habitats. We investigated the following hypotheses (H): (H1) there are more potential nesting sites (i.e., CWD) for carpenter ants inside than outside clearcuts; (H2a) absolute and (H2b) relative availabilities of carpenter ants are greater inside than outside clearcuts; (H3) Carpenter ant presence is best explained by the availability of CWD; (H4) the presence of bear sign on CWD is higher inside than outside clearcuts; (H5) brown bear selection of CWD on clearcuts is positively influenced by the presence-absence of carpenter ants; and (H6) bear selection on CWD is negatively influenced by proximity to human infrastructure (e.g. settlements and roads), denoting an avoidance of encounters with humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study area</title><p>The study area covered &#x0223c;800&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup> of intensively managed boreal forest in Dalarna and G&#x000e4;velborg counties in south-central Sweden (61&#x000b0;N, 14&#x000b0;E). The dominant tree species were Scots pine (<italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic>; covered 82% of the area) and Norway spruce (<italic>Picea abies</italic>; 12%). Approximately 450&#x02013;550&#x000a0;ha of forested stands are harvested per year (Anders Fr&#x000e4;&#x000e4;s, personal communication, 2010), with an approximate mean area for individual clearcuts of 25&#x000a0;ha (range: 0.1&#x02013;425&#x000a0;ha) and a rotation age of approximately 120&#x000a0;years (Orsa Besparingsskog forest company database 2009). The shrub layer typically consisted of common juniper <italic>(Juniperus communis</italic>), willows. (<italic>Salix</italic> spp<italic>.</italic>), and dwarf birch (<italic>Betula nana</italic>). The field layer was dominated by dwarf shrubs, such as bilberry (<italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic>), cowberry (<italic>V. vitis-idaea</italic>), crowberry (<italic>Empetrum</italic> spp<italic>.</italic>), and heather (<italic>Calluna vulgaris</italic>). Soil surface was covered by mosses and lichens. The landscape is undulating with elevations ranging from 240 to 720&#x000a0;m. The growing season (mean temperature &#x02a7e;5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) is 150&#x02013;180&#x000a0;days, with winter and summer mean temperatures at &#x02212;7&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 15&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, respectively. Mean precipitation during the vegetation period is about 350&#x02013;450&#x000a0;mm (<xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">Swenson et al., 1999</xref>), and snow cover is present from November until April or early May (<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Dahle et al., 1998</xref>).

Thirty-years was used as a cut-off, because silvicultural thinning regimes were soon after prescribed, which would have affected the availability of CWD. We selected 100 clearcuts from a digital map, based on the similarity of shape (i.e., regularity and roundness), area (4 classes: 0&#x02013;10, 11&#x02013;50, 51&#x02013;100,&#x0003e;100&#x000a0;ha), and age (6 classes: 0&#x02013;5, 6&#x02013;10, 11&#x02013;15, 16&#x02013;20, 21&#x02013;25, 26&#x02013;30&#x000a0;years) (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We extracted tree age from the forest company database (Orsa Besparingsskog), which was consistently two years after the previous harvest, giving time for the soil to &#x0201c;rest.&#x0201d; Therefore, we added two years to each database record of stand age to derive a more accurate clearcut age.</p><p>Within each clearcut, we set up sampling plots (10&#x000a0;m radius) along two perpendicular transects, running north&#x02013;south and east&#x02013;west, respectively. We maximized the clearcut area sampled via transect placement on a map. For clearcuts &#x02a7d;10&#x000a0;ha and &#x0003e;10&#x000a0;ha, spacing between plots were 50&#x000a0;m and 100&#x000a0;m, respectively (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We took GPS coordinates for each plot with a precision of 10&#x000a0;m. To obtain forest characteristics in the area adjacent to a clearcut, we sampled one additional plot in each of the four cardinal directions, at 25&#x000a0;m and 50&#x000a0;m from the clearcut edge for clearcuts &#x02a7d;10&#x000a0;ha and &#x0003e;10&#x000a0;ha, respectively. We sampled the clearcuts between 01 June and 06 August, 2003.</p><p>We removed plots located in water bodies, on roads, or within power-line clearings from analyses. We removed plots with missing variable information and incorrect GPS locations (rendering accurate variable extraction impossible in a geographic information system [GIS]). We also removed outside clearcut plots that were located in neighboring clearcuts (age&#x000a0;&#x02a7d;&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;years). As we were concerned with how carpenter ants and bears selected CWD, we only included inside and outside clearcut plots that contained CWD, as selection cannot occur on an unavailable unit.</p><p>For each plot, we measured tree height (4 classes: 0&#x02013;0.3&#x000a0;m; 0.3&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;m; 1.5&#x02013;2&#x000a0;m; &#x0003e;2&#x000a0;m) and visually estimated canopy cover (to the nearest 5%). Tree height was used as a proxy for horizontal cover and classes were chosen based on a bear&#x02019;s perspective, because, when assessing horizontal cover, it is important to address observation height relative to the target (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Collins and Becker, 2001</xref>). In this case, the observation would be from the bear, and the target would be any potential threat. We categorized the field layer into 3 ordinal types, in decreasing order of productivity, using a modified dichotomous key for assessing ground- and field-layer productivity (<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000e4;gglund and Lundmark, 1982</xref>): (1-high) herbs and grasses (e.g. <italic>Circium helenoides</italic> and <italic>Poa</italic> spp.), (2-medium) soil without a field layer, sedge-horsetail (e.g. <italic>Carex</italic> spp. and <italic>Equisetum</italic> spp.), and bilberry, and (3-low) cowberry, crowberry-heather (<italic>Empetrum spp.</italic> and <italic>Calluna vulgaris</italic>), poor dwarf-shrub (e.g. <italic>Betula nana</italic>), peat moss (<italic>Sphagnum</italic> spp.) and lichen (<italic>Lichen</italic> spp.). Soil type (rock, gravel, sand, sandy-loam, clay-loam, clay, peat) was extracted from soil data in a GIS. CWD consisted of standing dead trees, dead and down trees and/or cut down trees (logs), and above-ground residual stumps (post-harvest), all of which were &#x0003e;14&#x000a0;cm in diameter. Within plots, we counted all CWD items and recorded their circumference (cm, measurements at both ends of logs were averaged), species (pine, spruce, or deciduous), and hardness (3 categories; (1) little to no decay/hardest; (2) partly decayed/intermediate; (3) mostly decayed/softest). To identify hardness level and to ascertain the presence of carpenter ants, eggs, larvae, pupae, and carpenter ant galleries (hereafter galleries), we used an axe to split open the CWD. We also noted bear foraging of CWD (presence or absence) as CWD that was forcibly opened and/or excavated, yet lacking channeled excavations (e.g. caused by woodpeckers) or a crushed appearance (e.g. caused by forestry equipment) Time of occurrence (i.e. which year) was not determinable for galleries and bear sign on CWD.</p><p>Therefore, we used cumulative data for both carpenter ant galleries and bear sign for analyses, in which each was used as a proxy for carpenter ant presence and bear use, respectively. Due to the uncertain times of occurrence for galleries and bear sign on CWD and to increase confidence in our model output, we simulated what the frequency of occurrence for each gallery and bear sign would look like if it were constant over time, i.e. a constant rate across age intervals<italic><sub>k</sub></italic> (6 intervals: 0&#x02013;5, 6&#x02013;10, 11&#x02013;15, 16&#x02013;20, 21&#x02013;25, 26&#x02013;30&#x000a0;years). For each gallery and bear sign, we calculated this constant (<italic>C</italic>) by summing respective observed frequencies of occurrence (<italic>Observed</italic>) across age intervals (<italic>k&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;</italic>6) and divided the sum by the total number of incremental time units, i.e., the sum of <italic>k</italic> age intervals (Eq. <xref rid="e0005" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref>).

Modeling of parameters inside and outside clearcuts was not possible, as the hierarchical spatial dependency of CWD sampled inside clearcuts (i.e., random factor levels of clearcut and plot ids) could not be appropriately applied to CWD sampled outside clearcuts. All plots inside a particular clearcut represent a specific habitat patch (3rd order; <italic>sensu</italic>

Plots representing these patches could vary substantially in species composition and structure (e.g. a plot east of the same clearcut in the previous example may consist of a lichen understory with a sparser mature pine over-story), yet have a sample size of only one for comparison. Therefore we only modeled CWD from inside clearcuts.

Not surprisingly, with more nesting sites inside clearcuts, we also found (H2a) more galleries inside clearcut plots than outside them. Even after controlling for differences in the number of potential nesting sites (i.e., CWD count) carpenter ants colonized available nesting sites more frequently inside than outside clearcuts (H2b). This indicated that there are clearcut characteristics which provide advantages beyond just the availability of potential nesting sites, as proposed by <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">Rolstad et al.

Nest &#x0201c;quality,&#x0201d; which depends on microhabitat attributes surrounding CWD (<xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Punttila et al., 1991</xref>), most likely plays a role in whether carpenter ants select CWD.

Overall, the gallery model results supported the prediction (H3) that carpenter ant selection of CWD depended on available wood (or nesting sites) (<xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">Rolstad et al., 1998</xref>). A higher CWD circumference may provide a more climatically stable nesting site or be a determinant factor in colony size, both of which may enhance colony persistence at a nest site (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;lldobler and Wilson, 1990</xref>). Carpenter ants appeared to be most prevalent in intermediately hard (partly decayed) CWD, and, in spite of the scale at which it was measured, we suggest that CWD hardness simultaneously captured multi-featured and multi-scaled influences on selection. For example, CWD hardness was measured on the CWD item scale, whereas tree height at the plot scale and age at the clearcut scale. Notwithstanding the limited levels (i.e. only &#x0201c;softest&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;intermediate&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;hardest&#x0201d;) of the factor hardness, its relatively smaller scale most likely captured more variation than that of the continuous variable age at the larger clearcut scale. Although appropriately not included in the same model, due to collinearity, CWD hardness, plot tree height, and clearcut age probably represented differential scalar components of the same theme, e.g., the effects of forestry, microhabitat, and time on nest quality. When re-fitting the parsimonious gallery model with each of these collinear variables, they three had the lowest AICc scores among all candidate models (results not shown). To demonstrate, the frequency of occurrence of both galleries and bear sign followed relatively similar patterns across clearcut age (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) and were parallel to that of relative CWD hardness levels, where galleries were most likely to be found in intermediate hardness (and age) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and bear sign most likely on softer (or the oldest) CWD (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>The random factor variance for clearcut ID was higher than that for plot ID for both parsimonious gallery and bear models, suggesting that important large scale (3rd order; <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Johnson, 1980</xref>) explanatory variables may not have been included in the models beyond the spatial autocorrelation induced by our sampling design. These variables most likely represent a feature among clearcuts that gives them each variable characteristics, among which carpenter ants differentially select and persist (at the 4th order scale). For bears, the high variance in the clearcut ID random factor could be from a CWD selection process that is grouped at the clearcut level. This pattern could be caused by bears exhibiting fidelity toward certain clearcuts within their home ranges, due to successful foraging experience and higher security. Specifically, female bears with cubs may forage on clearcuts and close to humans, in order to avoid infanticide by adult males (<xref rid="b0160 b0360 b0100" ref-type="bibr">Libal et al., 2011; Steyaert et al., 2013; Elfstr&#x000f6;m et al., 2014</xref>). As a result, lacking individual bear identities in our models could mask the strength of a variable (e.g. proximity of a settlement to a clearcut), due to diluting effects from individual variation (i.e. some bears select whereas others avoid clearcuts closer to settlements). However, this effect would strengthen variables important for &#x0201c;nonselection&#x0201d; by individual bears and would not affect the selection of the CWD in our study. In other words, the results of this study should not necessarily be attributed to all bears as our data resulted from bear sign, i.e., those bears which decided to forage on CWD.</p><p>Similar to carpenter ants, our prediction (H4) that bears would select more CWD within clearcuts than outside them was supported. Clearcuts may provide characteristics that other forest types lack, such as the necessary habitat for carpenter ants to thrive, along with adequate cover from the early stages of secondary growth, under which bears can safely forage. Success rates were both high (&#x02a7e;88%) and no difference was detected between inside and outside clearcuts, but this is probably due to a low sample size outside of clearcuts (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8) for comparison.</p><p>Important predictors of bear selection of CWD paralleled those of carpenter ant selection of CWD (i.e., clearcut age compared with CWD hardness, and circumference and volume remaining the same) with one crucial difference, the availability of ants. Prediction (H5), that ant availability is a relatively strong predictor for bear use, was supported by the bear model, in which the presence or absence of galleries was the most important variable (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There was a clear distinction between brown bear selection on CWD with and without galleries, the latter receiving virtually no use at all. This and the high success rate of bear foraging sign on CWD is a strong indication that bears knew whether or not ants were present in CWD when they decided to forage. However, this should be interpreted with caution, because it is possible that bears opened some CWD after carpenter ants had abandoned the nest.</p><p>However, there were differences in selection between bears and carpenter ants, as bears appeared to have a higher probability of selecting CWD in older clearcuts, which correlates with selecting softer CWD, whereas ants had a higher probability of selecting CWD of intermediate hardness (or medium aged clearcuts). Bears seemed to select CWD hierarchically, whereas ants less so. This was evident when we re-fitted both the gallery and bear models, using clearcut age in place of CWD hardness, and the parsimonious bear model exchanged hardness for clearcut age, but the parsimonious gallery model remained the same. Although the relative importance of clearcut age for bears was less than CWD-specific attributes (e.g. circumference and whether or not galleries were present) (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), the selection of CWD was best shaped by clearcut characteristics, i.e., most likely captured by clearcut age. This is further supported by the lowered variance of the clearcut ID random intercept for the parsimonious model with clearcut age instead of CWD hardness (results not shown).</p><p>If brown bears expended less effort and time in opening softer CWD (on older clearcuts), these results are in line with optimal foraging theory, in which animals are able to recognize and maximize the profitability of prey (defined as net food yield per unit handling time) (<xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">Stephens and Krebs, 1986</xref>). However, old and fresh bear sign was indistinguishable, meaning it was not possible to know when the bears actually foraged on CWD; our models may be using improperly assigned age and hardness attributes to bear sign. Nonetheless, the expected accumulation of use up to a given year interval, when compared to the observed data, is congruent with results from the parsimonious models (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). For example, the biggest disparities for gallery occurrence are during age intervals 11&#x02013;15 (occurring more than expected) and 26&#x02013;30&#x000a0;years (occurring less than expected), correlating with the variable hardness in our model output (<xref rid="s0075" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2</xref>), as ants selected more for CWD with intermediate hardness than the softest. Likewise, our bear models detected an increasing trend in CWD selection (if galleries were present); top right panel in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) with increasing clearcut age, a pattern seen in both the observed and simulated data (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), lending confidence to our model results.</p><p>Furthermore, CWD circumference had a positive relationship with bear foraging sign, presumably indicating that bears could find a higher abundance of ants there. Contrarily, CWD volume (collinear with CWD length), which may correlate with nest size and carpenter ant abundance, seemed unimportant for bears, suggesting that circumference may be linked to not just nest size, but the ease with which bears may forage a particular CWD item.</p><p>We found no evidence supporting (H6) that human activity-related variables influenced bear selection of clearcut CWD. It is likely that humans were avoided temporally (i.e., foraging during the crepuscular hours) rather than spatially (<xref rid="b0195 b0055 b0070" ref-type="bibr">Moe et al., 2007; Coleman et al., 2013; Cristescu et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the social organization of brown bears may influence clearcut and CWD selection, as brown bears show spatiotemporal segregation, depending on season and social status in North America (e.g. <xref rid="b0375 b0185 b0300" ref-type="bibr">Wielgus and Bunnell, 1994; McLoughlin et al., 2002; Rode et al., 2006</xref>) and in Scandinavia (<xref rid="b0360" ref-type="bibr">Steyaert et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Brown bears have highly sensitive olfaction (e.g. <xref rid="b0095 b0310 b0145" ref-type="bibr">Eisenberg and Kleiman, 1972; Rosell et al., 2011; Jojola et al., 2012</xref>) and they likely use it to locate carpenter ants. A question remains whether bears actively seek out only carpenter ants within clearcuts, or if they optimize their efforts and/or exhibit a functional response by utilizing multiple food sources in a preferential manner based on relative availability (<xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">Swenson et al., 1999</xref>). In Sweden, <xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">Swenson et al. (1999)</xref> determined that carpenter ants were preferred to other ant species in the summer, which was likely linked to their lower formic acid content with higher digestibility and fat. However, this preference and selection diminished, as another food source, i.e. berries, became available in autumn. In Scandinavia, two berry species, bilberries and crowberries, are particularly important for bears in building fat reserves for hibernation (<xref rid="b0105 b0365 b0260" ref-type="bibr">Elgmork and Kaasa, 1992; Swenson et al., 1999; Persson et al., 2001</xref>). Interannual and seasonal variation in berry abundance is, however, substantial (<xref rid="b0320 b0325 b0200" ref-type="bibr">Sel&#x000e5;s, 2000; Sel&#x000e5;s, 2001; Nestby et al., 2011</xref>). Considering the high foraging success rate brown bears had on CWD and the low amount of CWD items bears selected (and foraged) relative to available CWD with galleries, brown bears may forage on more carpenter ants during years of poor berry crops.</p><p>In Alberta, studies have shown that forestry (e.g. forest design, site preparation, and silviculture) can affect the occurrence of grizzly bear foods in clearcuts, as well as clearcut selection by brown bears (<xref rid="b0215 b0220" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2004a,b</xref>). In our study, we show that forest management decisions, such as stand rotation age and target diameter of trees, may increase (or decrease) carpenter ant occurrence, and consequently, bear selection of CWD with ants. <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al. (2004a)</xref> determined that clearcut shape and clearcut area-to-perimeter ratios were important for brown bear clearcut selection in Alberta. This could also be true in Sweden. Even though our sampling design emphasized the interior of clearcuts, giving less weight to the edges, it is unlikely that this or the area-to-perimeter had a large effect in our study, because we selected clearcuts of similar shape (i.e. roundness) and included clearcut area as a variable. However, the variation of carpenter ant and bear selection of CWD at the clearcut level (i.e. variation of the clearcut ID random intercept), and the inclusion of clearcut age in the bear parsimonious model, may indicate differential features among the clearcuts, which could be attributed to more specific forest treatments (e.g. site preparation or stand tending prescriptions), but we did not have enough data to evaluate this.</p><p>Brown bears appeared to very efficiently select on CWD where carpenter ant galleries were present. The mechanism by which brown bears locate carpenter ants in CWD warrants more attention, as this could constrain or flexibly enable brown bears to exploit a food item under uncertain future effects from habitat modification and anthropogenic influence (e.g. forest management, hunting and climate change).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0065"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The probability of carpenter ant selection and brown bear selection on CWD revealed similar important factors on the CWD and clearcut scales that could be linked to forest management and microhabitat attributes. Carpenter ant gallery presence was most influenced by CWD hardness (which was related to tree height and clearcut age) and circumference, whereas brown bear foraging on clearcut CWD was most influenced by whether or not galleries were present, CWD circumference and clearcut age.</p><p>Clearcuts appeared to increase the availability and selection of carpenter ants by brown bears within a managed forest mosaic. For the purposes of increasing a brown bear summer food item, it appears that target diameter of felled trees has the biggest influence on both carpenter ant presence and consequent selection by brown bears. Therefore, it may be possible to increase the availability of carpenter ants by adjusting stand rotation age and/or target diameters of trees.</p><p>However, one must guard against the assumption that clearcuts will always favor brown bears, even if it may favor a food item within this managed mosaic. In other words, it is unclear if clearcuts benefit brown bears in general in Sweden, as an understanding of the relationship between the seasonal and interannual variation of the availability of carpenter ants and other important food items (i.e. berries), in addition to other primary needs for bears (e.g. secure habitat and denning habitat), on the landscape scale, is lacking. For example, clearcuts may act as attractive sinks, particularly where human-caused mortality is high in relation to roads, which would counteract any short-term benefit bears may derive from the increased availability of food items (<xref rid="b0225 b0230" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2006; Nielsen et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, if brown bears indeed consume more carpenter ants during poor berry crop years, i.e. due to localized unavailability (<xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">Swenson et al. 1999</xref>), adaptive silvicultural treatments within managed systems could be used to help buffer against future effects of climatic changes on brown bear food items.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abensperg-Traun</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Boer</surname><given-names>E.S.D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The foraging ecology of a termite-and ant-eating specialist, the echidna Tachyglossus aculeatus (Monotremata: Tachyglossidae)</article-title><source>J.
