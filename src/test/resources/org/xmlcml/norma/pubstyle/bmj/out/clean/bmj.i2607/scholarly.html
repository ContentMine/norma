Design  New initiator cohort study.  Setting  Data from United Health (October 2009 to June 2013), a commercial healthcare claims database in the United States.   Participants  21 934 adults with atrial fibrillation initiating dabigatran (150 mg dose only) or warfarin treatment as part of routine care.   Main outcome measures  Predicted annual rates of thromboembolism or major bleeding, based on estimates from randomized controlled trials, models developed in routine care patients, and baseline risk scores (CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and HAS-BLED). Thromboembolism was a composite outcome, including primary inpatient diagnosis codes for ischemic or ill defined stroke, transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and systemic embolism. Major bleeding was a composite outcome including codes occurring in an inpatient setting for hemorrhagic stroke; major upper, lower, or unspecified gastrointestinal bleed; and major urogenital or other bleed.   Results  6516 (30%) and 15 418 (70%) of patients initiated dabigatran and warfarin, respectively. Annual event rates per 100 patients were 1.7 for thromboembolism and 4.6 for major bleeding. For thromboembolism, calibration of estimates from randomized controlled trials was similar to calibration for model based predictions; however, trial estimates for major bleeding consistently underestimated the rate of bleeding among patients in routine care. Underestimation of bleeding rates was particularly pronounced in warfarin initiators with high HAS-BLED scores, where event rates were underestimated by up to 4.0 per 100 patient years. Harrell’s c indices for discrimination for thromboembolism or major bleeding in dabigatran and warfarin initiators ranged between 0.59 and 0.66 for randomized controlled trial predictions, and between 0.52 and 0.70 for cross validated model based predictions.  Conclusion  Estimated rates of thromboembolism under dabigatran or warfarin treatment in randomized controlled trials were close to observed rates in routine care patients.

Major bleeding was a composite outcome including codes occurring in an inpatient setting for hemorrhagic stroke; major upper, lower, or unspecified gastrointestinal bleed; and major urogenital or other bleed. </p> <p id="p-7"><strong>Results</strong> 6516 (30%) and 15 418 (70%) of patients initiated dabigatran and warfarin, respectively. Annual event rates per 100 patients were 1.7 for thromboembolism and 4.6 for major bleeding. For thromboembolism, calibration of estimates from randomized controlled trials was similar to calibration for model based predictions; however, trial estimates for major bleeding consistently underestimated the rate of bleeding among patients in routine care. Underestimation of bleeding rates was particularly pronounced in warfarin initiators with high HAS-BLED scores, where event rates were underestimated by up to 4.0 per 100 patient years. Harrell’s c indices for discrimination for thromboembolism or major bleeding in dabigatran and warfarin initiators ranged between 0.59 and 0.66 for randomized controlled trial predictions, and between 0.52 and 0.70 for cross validated model based predictions. </p> <p id="p-8"><strong>Conclusion</strong> Estimated rates of thromboembolism under dabigatran or warfarin treatment in randomized controlled trials were close to observed rates in routine care patients.

The trial predictions also fit poorly in dabigatran initiators using each of the different major bleeding criteria (P values ranging from 0.05 to 0.09). Predicted baseline rates per 100 patient years from the HAS-BLED score also underestimated the observed rate of major bleeding in patients who initiated warfarin (P&amp;lt;0.001). Model based predictions had the best fit for the observed rate of major bleeding per 100 patient years in both dabigatran and warfarin initiators (table 2<a id="xref-table-wrap-2-3" class="xref-up-link" href="#T2"><span>⇑</span></a>). </p> <p id="p-54">Tables 3 and 4<a id="xref-table-wrap-3-1" class="xref-down-link" href="#T3 T4"><span>⇓</span></a> shows the predicted rates of thromboembolism and major bleeding per 100 patient years after adjustment for confounders.

The model based and trial based predictions for rate of thromboembolism per 100 patient years in dabigatran and warfarin treated patients were similar across low, medium, and high risk categories. Although the predicted rates of major bleeding per 100 patient years varied depending on the criteria for defining major bleeding events used in the randomized controlled trial, each criterion predicted similar event rates for dabigatran and warfarin treated patients. By contrast, model based predicted rates of major bleeding were higher in warfarin initiators than in dabigatran initiators; this difference in rate of bleeding was greatest in patients at high baseline risk. </p> <div id="T3" class="table pos-float"> <div class="table"> <div class="table-caption"><span class="table-label">Table 3</span> <p id="p-55" class="first-child">Predicted rates of thromboembolism per 100 patient years in patients initiating dabigatran or warfarin as part of routine care </p> <div class="sb-div caption-clear" /> </div> </div> <div /> </div> <div id="T4" class="table pos-float"> <div class="table"> <div class="table-caption"><span class="table-label">Table 4</span> <p id="p-60" class="first-child">Predicted rates of major bleeding per 100 patient years in patients initiating dabigatran or warfarin as part of routine care </p> <div class="sb-div caption-clear" /> </div> </div> <div /> </div> <p id="p-66">Results for supplementary analyses using a combined thromboembolism outcome that excluded transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis are available in the web appendix. </p> </div> </div> <div class="section discussion" id="sec-16"> <h2 class="">Discussion</h2> <div id="sec-17" class="subsection"> <h3>Principal results </h3> <p id="p-67">In this study of patients initiating warfarin or dabigatran as part of routine care, use of estimates from the RE-LY randomized controlled trial<a id="xref-ref-3-7" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a> performed as well as models developed within a routine care population at predicting the rate of thromboembolism per 100 patient years under dabigatran or warfarin treatment. Trial estimates for major bleeding consistently underestimated bleeding risk for patients treated as part of routine care. The poor calibration of the trial estimated rate of bleeding to the observed rate in the routine care population is probably related to several factors, including enrollment of a high proportion of participants with demonstrated tolerance to warfarin and systematic exclusion of patients with conditions that put them at higher risk of bleeding. These factors resulted in distributions of patient characteristics and range in baseline risks quite different from what might be observed in routine care. That the RE-LY trial included "persistent" users further speaks to the difficulty in trying to use trial data to inform real world practice decisions. In addition, predicted rates of major bleeding within low, medium, and high risk categories were not available from a single head-to-head trial and had to be interpolated using published information from two trials. This interpolation highlights the practical difficulty for healthcare providers using trial results to inform treatment decisions. </p> </div> <div id="sec-18" class="subsection"> <h3>Clinical implications</h3> <p id="p-68">Randomized controlled trials are an essential method for determining the efficacy of medications, and healthcare professionals regularly rely on the results of trials to make important treatment decisions for individual patients. However, trials often are conducted in restricted populations with characteristics that differ from those of patients treated in routine practice. In addition, an average estimate found in a trial might mask considerable heterogeneity in treatment effect.<a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26">26</a> Our results suggest that, once trials have determined efficacy of a drug, analyses of observational data of patients treated in routine practice can be of great value for providing tailored estimates of risk for relevant benefit or safety outcomes under alternative treatment strategies. </p> <p id="p-69">Our results are most useful for a clinician and patient dyad trying to choose among no treatment, dabigatran, or warfarin when they know that the patient has certain risk factors included in the established CHADS<sub>2</sub> and HAS-BLED risk scores. From these two scores, they have a sense of expected event rates if untreated, but ideally, to inform their decision, they would like to know the expected event rates if the patient were to initiate dabigatran or warfarin. Two potential sources of this information are randomized controlled trials, which is the status quo, and observational data, which are becoming increasingly available. Informed by the most accurate evidence available, physician-patient dyads can make patient centered shared decisions regarding treatment. </p> <p id="p-70">There are some situations in which randomized controlled trials are the only source of evidence to inform decision making. For example, in the case of new drug treatments entering the market, there will be a period during which there are insufficient data from clinical practice to be able to develop and validate prediction models for relevant outcomes, especially if the outcomes are also rare. However, there are many situations in which it is difficult to obtain estimates of risk from trials for important benefit or safety outcomes given clinically relevant treatment alternatives. For instance, when there is no risk score available on which to stratify baseline outcome probability, there are no head-to-head trials comparing relevant treatment alternatives on outcomes of interest, estimates of absolute risk differences are available only for the entire trial population and not within a specific risk score range, and trial inclusion and exclusion criteria result in major differences between trial and clinical practice populations. </p> <p id="p-71">Although other studies have previously found that randomized controlled trials underestimate bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation,<a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-27">27</a> our study highlights the potential use of secondary, electronically captured patient data to develop risk models to guide treatment decision making. Our results suggested that if physicians and patients relied on predicted bleeding rates based on data from the trial, they might substantially underestimate bleeding risk. In situations where model based predictions can be demonstrated to be more accurate for patients treated as part of routine care, they may prefer to use these predicted event rates as one factor in the decision making process. Using large databases to develop and validate models, which can be iteratively updated over time, can provide stratified estimates of absolute risk to guide decision making and enhance patient care. The performance of such models can be internally cross validated, validated within data source over time, or validated across data sources. Estimates from models based on populations treated in routine care settings are naturally calibrated to a clinical population in which predicted individual risks could be used to guide clinical care. Risk models developed within large observational data sources also have the benefit of being able to be adaptively updated as practice patterns change, indications for use expand, or new treatments emerge for which there are no head-to-head trials. </p> </div> <div id="sec-19" class="subsection"> <h3>Study limitations</h3> <p id="p-72">Our study was limited by the focus on dabigatran and warfarin, without evaluation of the other novel oral anticoagulation agents that have recently entered the market. The relatively small number of patients in our observational data who initiated dabigatran in routine care and had thromboembolic outcomes during the study limited the reliability of the model based predictions for patients exposed to dabigatran. However, with larger data sources, and accrual of greater experience with dabigatran, one would expect that model based predictions would become increasingly more reliable while the trial based predictions would not change. </p> <p id="p-73">Our approach was also limited by the inability to capture important clinical variables that are not typically measured in electronic claims data (eg, smoking, body mass index). Under-recording of HAS-BLED risk factors in observational data could result in higher observed rates of bleeding within HAS-BLED risk categories owing to patients who are misclassified into lower risk categories. However, the greatest differences between the randomized controlled trial data and observational data predictions were in the high risk HAS-BLED category (score ≥3). These patients would not have been assigned a higher risk category had more HAS-BLED risk factors been captured in observational data. Furthermore, in spite of potential under-recording of risk factors in observational data, it is likely that that the average HAS-BLED score for routine care patients at high baseline risk of bleeding was still higher than the average score in trials participants with a HAS-BLED score of 3 or more. However, the mean score within HAS-BLED risk categories was not reported from the trials, so this cannot be evaluated. </p> <p id="p-74">The median duration of follow-up while on treatment was shorter in routine care (median &amp;lt;6 months) than in the randomized controlled trials (median 24 months), and half of trial participants were not naive to oral anticoagulation at the time of randomization. The higher rates of major bleeding observed in routine care patients could be partly attributed to exclusive contribution of person time from the first months following initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy. By contrast, rates from the trials included person time from participants with demonstrated tolerance for anticoagulants as well as person time further from initiation of treatment than was observed in the routine care patients. </p> <p id="p-75">Another limitation was how outcomes were defined in the randomized controlled trials versus the observational data. Trial outcomes were based on prespecified and adjudicated criteria whereas outcomes in the observational data were defined on the basis of previously validated claims algorithms. These differences in outcome assessment could have contributed to the differences in rates. Furthermore, there were concerns raised by the US Food and Drug Administration and others regarding how major bleeding events were ascertained and counted in the RE-LY trial.<a id="xref-ref-28-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-28">28</a> Although targeted reviews did not result in changes to the distribution of major bleeding across study arms that altered the main findings, misclassified events could contribute to the poor calibration of trial based predictions to bleeding in routine care patients. </p> <p id="p-76">There was also potential for residual confounding in the reported adjusted rates of thromboembolism or major bleeding for dabigatran and warfarin within the risk categories of the CHADS<sub>2</sub> and HAS-BLED scores. The stabilized inverse probability weights we used only adjust for the covariates that were included in the estimation of the weights, and there could be residual confounding from confounders that were not included. </p> <p id="p-77">Finally, in spite of our repeated cross validation, it is possible that the model based estimates were still over fit to the data, making performance of the model based estimates overly optimistic. The performance of model based predictions could be quite different if applied to a different large healthcare database that covers a different patient mix. Although model based predictions might not be as useful to patients outside of the type of patients found in a specific large healthcare data source, they can still be quite accurate and of considerable benefit for patients who are captured within that large healthcare data source. Furthermore, the process we have described can be readily applied to regularly update estimates over time and obtain tailored estimates within other large healthcare data sources. </p> </div> <div id="sec-20" class="subsection"> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p id="p-78">Currently, risk scores are used to guide care for patients with atrial fibrillation, aiding with the decision of whether to initiate oral anticoagulation therapy, but not which oral anticoagulant to select. Risk stratified event rates while on alternative treatments can be used to enhance informed decision making. Although no risk score is perfect, more accurate estimates of event rates can help prescribers and patients make better informed decisions and improve patient centered care. In our example, models developed in routine care patients provided accurate, tailored estimates of risk and benefit under alternative oral anticoagulation therapies. </p> <div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-1"> <div id="sec-21" class="subsection"> <h4>What is already known on this topic</h4> <ul class="list-simple " id="list-1"> <li id="list-item-1"> <p id="p-79">CHADS<sub>2</sub> and HAS-BLED are validated risk scores that estimate baseline risk of thromboembolism or major bleeding, respectively, in patients with atrial fibrillation to guide whether to initiate anticoagulation therapy; but these scores do not indicate which anticoagulant drug to use </p> </li> <li id="list-item-2"> <p id="p-80">Recent randomized controlled trials provide estimates of risk for thromboembolism and major bleeding under treatment with dabigatran or warfarin within low, medium, and high baseline risk categories </p> </li> <li id="list-item-3"> <p id="p-81">Trials have strict inclusion and exclusion criteria that can result in distributions of patient characteristics that are different from those observed in patients treated as part of routine care </p> </li> </ul> </div> <div id="sec-22" class="subsection"> <h4>What this study adds</h4> <ul class="list-simple " id="list-2"> <li id="list-item-4"> <p id="p-82">Models developed and validated using observational data performed as well as randomized controlled trials at predicting thromboembolism under treatment with dabigatran or warfarin in patients treated as part of routine care </p> </li> <li id="list-item-5"> <p id="p-83">These models performed better than trials at predicting major bleeding under treatment with dabigatran or warfarin in patients treated as part of routine care </p> </li> <li id="list-item-6"> <p id="p-84">Trials could underestimate the rate of major bleeding in routine care patients at the highest baseline risk for bleeding by up to 4.0 per 100 patient years </p> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section fn-group" id="fn-group-1"> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ul> <li class="fn-participating-researchers" id="fn-1"> <p id="p-85">Contributors: SVW drafted the protocol and statistical analysis plan as well as drafted and revised the paper.
