Data are n/N (%), unless otherwise indicated. SES=socioeconomic status. The rate for reporting not smoking but failing to provide biochemical verification was 5% (207/4613) for the primary outcome and 9% (392/4613) for the secondary outcome; these rates were similar between the intervention groups in each SES subsample. Participants lost to follow-up were counted as treatment failures. *Odds ratios rather than relative risks were specified as the measure of effect in the protocol. Relative risks were also calculated to improve understanding. †In the case of the adjusted analyses, p values relate to the log-binomial models used to calculate the relative risk. ‡The primary analyses were all unadjusted. Adjusted results are presented as a sensitivity analysis. The adjusted models include all characteristics presented in table 1.
