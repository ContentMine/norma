											<h3>Introduction</h3>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec1.p1"></a>
											<p>
												Echium (
												<em>Echium plantagineum</em>
												L., Boraginaceae) is a winter annual weed in Mediterranean
												climates
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Piggin1">[1]</a>
												. However, high concentrations of desirable fatty acids
												occur in its seeds, and its flowers are attractive to
												pollinators. Given its history as a weed elsewhere, attempts
												to grow echium as a crop are uncommon. The combined benefits
												of commercially valuable fatty acids coupled with the
												growing interest in supporting pollinators warrants further
												exploration of agricultural production of echium.
											</p>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec1.p2"></a>
											<p>
												Echium seeds contain about 27% oil that is enriched with
												high levels of stearidonic acid (SDA) and gamma-linolenic
												acid (GLA)
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Gray1">[2]</a>
												. These fatty acids are rare in plants and highly valued in
												the health and personal care industries. Stearidonic acid,
												in particular, is an essential ingredient in anti-wrinkle
												cosmetics, and both SDA and GLA provide health benefits
												analogous to fish oils
												<a href="#pone.0113556-GuilGuerrero1">[3]</a>
												.
											</p>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec1.p3"></a>
											<p>
												In addition to its seed oil value, echium is highly
												attractive to pollinating insects, especially honey bees.
												Echium is a common melliferous (honey producing) plant
												native to the Mediterranean Basin and naturalized throughout
												southern Australia, where it is used widely for honey
												production
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Corbet1">[4]</a>
												,
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Cullen1">[5]</a>
												,
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Davis1">[6]</a>
												. Nearly 15% of Australian honey is derived from echium
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Mathieson1">[7]</a>
												. Regions that support high densities of honey bee colonies
												and/or desire to augment nutritional resources for native
												pollinators have critical needs for such plants. Despite
												echium's ability to support pollinators, its history as a
												weed has limited its use as a crop.
											</p>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4"></a>
											<p>
												Reports on growing echium as a crop are rare. Berti et al.
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Berti1">[8]</a>
												reported seed yields of 115 to 617 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												for autumn-sown echium in Chillan Province, Chile. Echium
												also has been grown successfully as a spring-sown crop in
												the United Kingdom, with yields of 200 to 300 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												<a href="#pone.0113556-NNFCC1">[9]</a>
												; and at four locations in North Dakota, where yields ranged
												from 63 to 425 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												and averaged 251Â±29.5 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												across 12 site-years
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Berti2">[10]</a>
												. No weedy tendencies of echium in or near the North Dakota
												experimental sites were observed. Relationships between seed
												yields and growing season temperatures or rainfall totals
												(North Dakota Agricultural Weather Network values) in North
												Dakota were not obvious in our examination of the data from
												Berti et al.
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Berti2">[10]</a>
												, which indicated that the short growing season and
												relatively low rainfall of the Northern Great Plains did not
												restrict echium from achieving relatively high seed yields
												in some sites and years.
											</p>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec1.p5"></a>
											<p>
												Our interest in echium arose from a desire to extend floral
												resources for pollinators
												<em>via</em>
												high-value oilseed crops in the Upper Midwest and Northern
												Great Plains of the USA. This region supplies a large
												proportion of the nation's transient honey bee colonies, and
												such colonies suffer high yearly losses. Summer-time
												nutrition is thought to play an important role for
												subsequent over-winter survival and vigor during the
												colonies' fruit and nut pollination activities in California
												and other southern locations
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Brodschneider1">[11]</a>
												,
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Naug1">[12]</a>
												. Echium production in the Upper Midwest and Northern Great
												Plains may help solve this dilemma. Consequently, we
												examined the effects of echium sowing date on flowering
												dynamics, pollinator visitations, and seed yields, and the
												potential energy (nectar) an echium crop may provide to
												pollinators. Based on three years of data we were able to
												document extraordinary levels of flower production and
												pollinator visitation, as well as provide guidance regarding
												planting dates that assures both high seed yields and
												pollinator resources.

											<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>
											<h4>2.1 Plot establishment</h4>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p1"></a>
											<p>Experiments were performed at the USDA-ARS Swan Lake
												Research Farm, Stevens County, MN (45.68Â°N, 95.80Â°W) on a
												Barnes loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, super-active, frigid
												Calcic Hapludoll) during 2011, 2012, and 2013. Treatments
												(planting dates) were arranged in a randomized complete
												block design with three replications in 2011 and 2012. Plots
												were 3.1 by 12.2 m. In 2013, data were collected from four
												replications of each of two separate but proximal
												experiments involving nine oilseed crops, including echium.
												In the first experiment (May-sowing) the plots were 6.1 by
												18.3 m, and in the other (June and July sowings) the plots
												were 2.4 by 3.1 m. The variability in plot sizes is unlikely
												to have influenced flowering dynamics, but potentially could
												have affected pollinator visitation and seed yields.</p>

												Previous crops were soybean (
												<em>Glycine max</em>
												L. [Merr]) in 2010 and wheat (
												<em>Triticum aestivum</em>
												L.) otherwise. Fertilizer was applied at a rate of 77-33-33
												kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												of N-P-K and incorporated with the field cultivator or a
												no-till drill at sowing. Fertilizer applications were based
												on those recommended in the NNFCC crop fact sheet
												<a href="#pone.0113556-NNFCC1">[9]</a>
												. For weed control, trifluralin herbicide (2,6-dinitro-

												dipropyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)aniline) was applied preplanting
												at 0.75 kg ai ha
												<sup>â1</sup>

												Echium seeds were obtained originally from Technology Crops
												International (TCI) in 2008. Harvested seeds were cleaned
												and resown each year thereafter. Seeds were sown 1.5 to 2.5
												cm deep in rows spaced by 20 cm and at a rate of 11 to 17 kg
												seed ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												depending upon viability (TCI growing guide for echium
												recommends a seeding rate of 11 kg viable seed ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												based on germination percent of seed stocks).

											<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p4"></a>
											<p>
												Sowing dates were May 26 and July 7, 2011; April 25 and June
												15, 2012; and May 14, June 13, and July 8, 2013 (
												<a href="#pone-0113556-t001">table 1</a>
												). Early sowing of echium was completed as soon as field
												conditions allowed each spring. Late sowing was as near to 7
												weeks after early sowing as was possible based on weather
												conditions. Late sowing of echium was done 6, 7, and 8 weeks
												after early sowing in 2011, 2012, and 2013 respectively. An
												additional mid-season sowing date was planted on June 13,
												2013 (4 weeks after the early sowing) in order to evaluate
												if seed yields could be improved relative to the late sowing
												and to provide uninterrupted floral resources to pollinators
												from early summer to autumn.

												<a href="foo">http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htâm?docid=3512
												</a>
												). Cumulative soil thermal times (at 5 cm depth; base

											<h4>2.2 Flowering Dynamics</h4>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1"></a>
											<p>Percent ground cover of echium flowers (flower area) was
												estimated visually in each plot from the time open flowers
												were first visible through the end of anthesis for all three
												years. Visual estimates were made by two observers by
												viewing the crop from above and approximating the percent of
												the total area that was covered by flowers. Cumulative
												flower area was estimated by calculating the areas under the
												curves throughout anthesis. These integrals represent the
												coverage time (%t) of flower area. Anthesis duration was
												measured from the start of flowering to the time of
												swathing; because echium is an indeterminate crop, anthesis
												persisted until the crop was harvested.</p>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p2"></a>
											<p>
												In 2013, number of open flowers were measured once per week
												during anthesis using the Batcheler corrected point distance
												estimation
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Rempel1">[13]</a>
												. A 1.8 m transect rope with six pre-marked points 30 cm
												apart was used to establish three transects within each
												plot. The distance from each point to the center of the
												nearest open flower was measured, as was the distance from
												the center of the first open flower to the center of the
												next nearest open flower. Measurements were taken on at
												least five different dates throughout anthesis for each
												planting date. During field measurements, the maximum search
												distance for a flower was set to 15 cm to ensure that
												individual flowers were not included more than once. During
												data analysis, the maximum search distance for each date was
												adjusted to exclude approximately 30% of the flowers, as per
												Remple
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Rempel1">[13]</a>
												. Calculations of flower density (f ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												) were performed using Transect Point Density software
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Kushneriuk1">[14]</a>
												. The average flower density within each planting date was
												plotted by the day of year. The sum of flowers produced per
												hectare throughout anthesis (âf ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												) was calculated by integrating the area under the curve.
											</p>
											<h4>2.3 Nectar Collection and Analysis</h4>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p1"></a>
											<p>
												Nectar analysis was performed on early-sown echium flowers
												on July 16 and August 7, 2013, following protocols described
												by Corbet et al.
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Corbet2">[15]</a>
												. On the former date the mean temperature was 26.4Â°C, mean
												solar radiation was 0.33 kwh/m
												<sup>2</sup>
												(PAR = 479), with a mean RH of 71%, and no measurable
												rainfall 24 h before nectar was removed. On the latter date
												the mean temperature was 18.2Â°C, mean solar radiation was
												0.30 kwh/m
												<sup>2</sup>
												(PAR = 525), with a mean RH of 74%, and 0.64 cm of rainfall
												24 h before nectar was removed. Nectar was extracted from 10
												open flowers using a 1, 5, or 10 ÂµL microcapillary. The
												length of the nectar column in the microcapillary was
												measured immediately after extraction. Degree Brix (Â°Bx; %
												sucrose) was recorded for each flower using an Eclipse low
												volume handheld refractometer (Bellingham + Stanley Inc, GA,
												USA). âStanding cropsâ of nectar were removed at three time
												points: 900, 1200, and 1500 h, from 10 different flowers at
												each time, and the flowers were tagged and isolated with
												insect exclusion bags. After 2 h of exclusion, the flowers
												were resampled for nectar volume and Â°Bx. Nectar volume was
												calculated by dividing the length of the nectar column by
												the total length of the microcapillary and multiplying by
												the microcapillary volume. Sugar content was calculated from
												the Corbet et al.
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Corbet2">[15]</a>
												equation for nectar sucrose content:

												<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p2"></a>
												<p>giving the total sucrose produced in 2 h by a single
													echium flower. The Âµg of sucrose produced was averaged
													across the two sampling dates for the 10 flowers sampled
													during each time interval. The daily sucrose production per
													echium flower was approximated by summing the average Âµg of
													sucrose produced during each of the three time intervals.
													The sum of flowers produced per hectare throughout anthesis
													was multiplied by the daily sucrose production of a single
													echium flower to calculate the potential sucrose production
													of a hectare of echium throughout anthesis.</p>
												<h4>2.4 Insect Counts</h4>
												<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec4.p1"></a>
												<p>Pollinator
													visitations to the plots were recorded from the time open
													flowers were first visible through the end of anthesis.
													Visitation was documented by investigators walking along
													the length of each plot for 1â2 minutes and listing the
													number of individuals observed in each of the following
													insect categories: honey bee, bumble bee, other bee, fly,
													butterfly, and other insects. Insect counts were conducted
													between 1100 and 1400 h on rainless days, with wind speeds
													&lt;7 m s
													<sup>â1</sup>,
													when the temperature &gt;5Â°C and the sky was â¥50% clear or
													when the temperature was &gt;10Â°C with any sky cover. All
													insect counts were divided by the number of observers and
													the minutes of each observation period giving number of
													insects observed by one observer in 1 min. Integrating
													under the curves of pollinator-time relationships allowed
													calculation of pollinator visitation time (pvt) throughout
													anthesis. A ratio of insect visitation to flower area was
													derived by dividing pvt by %t for each planting date. A
													larger value indicates more insects per flower area. The
													52-ha research farm harbored one commercial-grade honey bee
													colony in 2011 and 2012, and four colonies in 2013. In
													addition, a commercial apiary with 34 hives was located
													within two miles of the research farm, which supported
													consistent bee visitation each year. Otherwise, the
													research farm was surrounded by narrow strips of
													semi-natural vegetation (tree-lined lakeshore, woodland,
													wetlands, and grassed fence lines and roadsides), which
													likely provided nesting habitat for native pollinators.
												</p>
												<h4>2.5 Seed Harvest</h4>
												<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec5.p1"></a>
												<p>
													Echium seeds were harvested by swathing sections in each
													plot on September 15 and October 25, 2011; August 12 and
													September 12, 2012; for the early and late planted plots,
													respectively and August 23, 2013 for the early planted
													plot. The 2013 mid planted plot was harvested on September
													11 by straight combining without swathing. The 2013 late
													planted plot was harvested on October 10 by hand harvesting
													two rows, allowing the plant material to dry, and hand
													threshing the seed. Variation in harvesting techniques in
													2013 was unavoidable due to unforeseen problems with
													machinery and labor availability. Swaths typically were 1.5
													m wide and the length of the plot. Swathing and direct
													harvesting occurred when the bottom third of former flowers
													along branches of the cyme-type infructescence had black
													seeds (dried and fully mature), the middle third had
													grayish seeds (physiologically mature), and the upper third
													had green seeds or still-maturing flowers
													<a href="#pone.0113556-TechnologyCropsInternational1">[16]</a>
													. Echium does not have seed pods; instead, its fruits are
													small nutlets, typically four per flower, whose dark colors
													are easily visible at the base of the mature tubular calyx,
													the corolla having abscised earlier. Swaths were combined
													or hand threshed (small plots in 2013). Seeds were dried
													and chaff removed prior to calculating yield based upon 10%
													seed moisture
													<a href="#pone.0113556-TechnologyCropsInternational1">[16]</a>
													.

												<h4>2.6 Statistical Analysis</h4>
												<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec6.p1"></a>
												<p>
													Estimation of open flower density was done using Transect
													Point Density software
													<a href="#pone.0113556-Kushneriuk1">[14]</a>
													, which calculates a corrected point density (CPD, open
													flower density) based on point to object densities and
													adjusts for clustering within the plots giving a 95%
													confidence limit. There were a total of 72 points used to
													calculate the CPD for each date. Standard error was
													calculated by subtracting the lower confidence limit from
													the upper confidence limit and dividing by the t value
													multiplied by two. Multiple regression modeling was
													performed using stepwise selection in SAS 9.3 statistical
													software. Predictor variables for anthesis period were
													modeled using sowing date (early, mid, late), days to
													flower (days from sowing to first flower),
													anthesis-rainfall, vegetative-rainfall, anthesis thermal
													time (from first flower to harvest), and total thermal
													time. Yield was modeled using sowing date, growing season
													days (from sowing to swathing), thermal time,
													anthesis-rainfall, and vegetative-rainfall. Only variables
													with a
													<em>P</em>-value
													&lt;0.15 were included in the model. Standardized
													regression coefficients (SRC) are computed in SAS 9.3 by
													dividing a parameter estimate by the ratio of the sample
													standard deviation of the dependent variable to the sample
													standard deviation of the regressor (SAS 9.3). The SRC
													indicates how many standard deviations a given variable
													will change per standard deviation increase in the
													predictor variable independent of scale.

											<h3>Results and Discussion</h3>
											<h4>3.1 Flowering dynamics</h4>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p1"></a>
											<p>
												Time from sowing to first flower averaged 45 d and varied
												little across sowing dates. Flowering ended at swathing,
												typically in late August but extended into early October for
												late sowings. The average of 55 d for anthesis duration in
												the relatively wet climate of Minnesota was similar to
												flowering of cultivated and weedy populations in
												Mediterranean-like environments. The flowering period for
												echium is about 30 to 40 d in its native Mediterranean Basin
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Vivarelli1">[17]</a>
												, whereas in weedy populations in southern Australia, the
												duration of flowering is approximately 60 days
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Burdon1">[18]</a>
												. The anthesis duration of potted plants under natural light
												conditions was 71 d in southern Australia
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Piggin2">[19]</a>
												.
											</p>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec1.p2"></a>
											<p>
												Flowering peaked at or near 40% cover within 2 to 3 weeks of
												the start of flowering, and remained above 10% for most of
												anthesis (
												<a href="#pone-0113556-g001">figure 1aâc</a>
												). In 2011, the anthesis duration, was about 70 d for both
												planting dates (
												<a href="#pone-0113556-t001">table 1</a>
												). In contrast, flowering duration was shorter during 2012
												and 2013 ranging from 34â57 d. Stepwise selection multiple
												regression modeling indicated days to first flower,
												anthesis-rainfall, and vegetative-rainfall were significant
												variables in determining anthesis duration, with negative,
												positive, and positive coefficients, respectively (
												<a href="#pone-0113556-t002">table 2</a>
												). Thus, the lower the number of days to first flower from
												sowing, the longer the duration of flowering. Rainfall
												during anthesis was most strongly associated with increased
												anthesis time (SRC = 0.42;
												<a href="#pone-0113556-t002">table 2</a>
												): as anthesis rainfall increased so did the number of
												anthesis days. Therefore, drought conditions during July
												2012, during anthesis of the late-planted echium, likely
												contributed to the short duration of flowering that year.
												Higher rainfall during vegetative growth also increased
												flowering duration.

												Coverage times of flower area (%t) for early- and

												2013, respectively. The mid-sowing date for echium in 2013
												had 929%t, which was 83% of the early-sown echium flower
												coverage time. For comparison with standard commodity crops,
												the 2013 flower coverage time for corn was 9%t and that for
												soybean was 2%t. These values are 57 and 215 times smaller
												than even the lowest %t of echium. Therefore, the combined
												extent and duration of flower availability to pollinators
												was much less in corn and soybean than in echium.

												In 2013, nectar was extracted from flowers at three time
												points on two dates during peak flowering, and nectar
												sucrose production was calculated on a 2-h basis for each
												time point (figure 3). Echium flowers produced nectar from
												900 to 1700 h, providing a food resource to foraging insects
												from dawn to dusk. Sucrose production for each time point
												was not significantly different between the two sampling
												dates, despite varying weather conditions
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Corbet3">[21]</a>
												. The cumulative nectar sucrose produced by an individual
												echium flower throughout the day was equivalent to 635 Âµg of
												sucrose d
												<sup>â1</sup>
												, with peak production from 12:00â14:00 h. The sum densities
												of flowers throughout anthesis was used to estimate the
												potential energy each sowing-date of echium would provide to
												pollinators by multiplying the cumulative nectar sucrose
												produced by a single flower in a day by the sum of flowers
												produced throughout anthesis. This estimate gave a potential
												of 641, 2911, and 609 kg of sucrose ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												season
												<sup>â1</sup>
												produced by the early, mid, and late planted echium,

												for echium suggests placement of two honey bee hives per

												potential to support 3â6 hives for an entire year while the
												mid-sown echium could have supported 15â29 hives on its
												nectar production. This level of colony support assumes
												(unrealistically) that the flowers produce nectar equally
												throughout anthesis and that honey bees forage the full

												Corbet and Delfosse
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Corbet1">[4]</a>
												reported a nectar sugar yield of 300 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												yr
												<sup>â1</sup>
												, which is about half of what we predicted for our early
												sown crop in 2013. They also reported that nectar secretion
												in echium is affected by density of flowers, with higher
												densities of flowers having lower secretion rates. We
												extracted nectar before peak flower density was reached in
												the 2013 early sown crop, thus nectar production later in
												the season may have decreased as the flower density
												increased. These assumptions likely led to overestimations
												of sucrose production. More detailed investigations into
												nectar production throughout anthesis, as well as pollen
												production, and foraging by honey bees, are needed to give a
												more accurate recommendation for hive densities that can be
												supported near echium fields. Regardless of inaccuracies,
												however, the results indicate that echium not only can
												support high densities of honey bee colonies, but can supply
												most of their annual energy needs during a single one- to
												two-month flowering/foraging season.

												Comparison of sugar production values by echium to those of
												soybean reveals the potential value of having echium on the
												landscape. Erickson
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Erickson1">[25]</a>
												,
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Erickson2">[26]</a>
												examined nectar production of several soybean varieties, but
												emphasized âHarkâ (MG I), which was attractive to honey
												bees. âHarkâ produced 0.01Â±0.002 ÂµL flower
												<sup>â1</sup>
												of nectar, and the sugar concentration of soybean nectar
												extracted directly from bee's stomachs was 36.2Â±1.94%,
												giving approximately 5 Âµg sugar per flower. Thus, at a
												flower density of 100â800 flowers per plant
												<a href="#pone.0113556-McGregor1">[20]</a>
												,
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Jiang1">[27]</a>
												and plant density of 0.5 million ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												we calculated approximately 0.5 to 4 L ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												of nectar and 0.25 to 2 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												of sugar would be available to nectar-gathering insects.
												Similarly, Severson and Erickson
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Severson1">[28]</a>
												reported soybean nectar carbohydrate (sugar) levels of 16 to
												134 Âµg flower
												<sup>â1</sup>
												for a range of cultivars. These values convert to 2 to 54 kg
												ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												of sugar at the same flower density mentioned above. In
												brief, even the highest value of nectar sugar production for
												soybean is an order of magnitude lower than that for echium.

												Pollinator visitation times (pvt) were 271 and 356 pvt in
												2011, 376 and 897 pvt in 2012, and 1787, 1774, and 2662 pvt
												in 2013 (
												<a href="#pone-0113556-t003">table 3</a>
												) for early and late planting dates, respectively. In 2011,
												2012, and 2013 the late planted echium had 132%, 239%, and
												149% higher pvt than the early planting dates. These data
												are surprising considering the %t was reduced in the later
												plantings. The ratio of pollinator visitation time to flower
												coverage time (pvt %t
												<sup>â1</sup>
												) increased in the later sown echium relative to the early
												sown echium each year (
												<a href="#pone-0113556-t003">table 3</a>
												). Results suggest that either insect populations early in
												the flowering season were too low to make full use of
												available echium flowers or, less likely, flowers of other
												plant species in the local area early in the season may have
												distracted pollinators from echium.
											</p>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p3"></a>
											<p>
												Honey bees comprised the majority of pollinators often
												representing more than half of the observed insects (
												<a href="#pone-0113556-g001">figure 1</a>
												gâi). Exceptions were at the beginning of the anthesis
												periods for each year and sowing date treatment when the
												flower area was very low. Presumably, at those times honey
												bee scouts had not yet found the echium flowers. Other
												insects, especially hoverflies (Syrphidae), were primary
												floral visitors during the earliest and latest observations
												of the flowering seasons. The additional three honey bee
												hives in 2013 may have contributed partially to the
												increased pvt; however, the other insect groups also had
												increased numbers in 2013 relative to 2011 and 2012,
												indicating that the increased pvt was not due solely to the
												increased presence of honey bees.
											</p>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p4"></a>
											<p>As a comparison to commodity crops, the pvt for corn and
												soybean in 2013 were 177 and 378, which were four and two
												times less than the lowest pvt for echium across all years,
												which shows that presence of echium provides valuable insect
												forage in a landscape dominated by corn and soybean. Honey
												bee visits to corn and soybean only accounted for 5 and 4%,
												respectively, of all insects observed, which was over 8
												times lower than the average proportion of honey bee visits
												of 42% in echium (data not shown).</p>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p5" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec3.p5"></a>
											<p>
												A caveat regarding echium as a forage resource for honey
												bees is that its pollen contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids,
												which is potentially harmful to mammals
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Hooper1">[32]</a>
												,
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Boppr1">[33]</a>
												. Alkaloids from the pollen may infuse into nectar in
												beehives and, thereby, contaminate honey. Fortunately, human
												exposure to contaminated honey is unlikely
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Culvenor1">[34]</a>
												,
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Australia1">[35]</a>
												, and the plants are common sources of safe honey in
												southern Australia
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Mathieson1">[7]</a>
												where echium is abundant. Consequently, use of echium as a
												melliferous plant on landscapes of the Upper Midwest and
												Northern Great Plains should not be problematic.

											<h4>3.4 Seed Yields</h4>
											<a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec4.p1"></a>
											<p>
												The average seed yield across all planting dates and years
												was 330Â±49 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												. Early-sown echium had 285, 386, and 167% higher yield than
												late-sown echium in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively (
												<a href="#pone-0113556-t001">table 1</a>
												). Across the three years, early planting dates averaged 510
												kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												, and late planting dates averaged 123 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												. The absolute highest yield was observed for the
												early-sowing date in 2011 and the lowest yield occurred
												during the drought year of 2012 for the late-sowing date.

												Seed yield modeled with stepwise selection methods indicated
												growing season days, vegetative rainfall, and anthesis
												rainfall were all significant terms in predicting yield (R
												<sup>2</sup>
												= 0.85,
												<a href="#pone-0113556-t004">table 4</a>
												). Thermal time was not a significant factor and not
												included in the final model. Rainfall during anthesis was
												positively associated with yield and had the highest
												standardized estimate and, therefore, the most influence on
												yield. Growing season days were correlated negatively with
												yield, meaning a longer growing period resulted in lower
												yield. This correlation may be explained partially by
												increased seed loss due to shattering as the echium crop
												matured longer.

											<p>In Minnesota, average rainfall in June and July is 102 and
												99 mm while that in August and September is only 85 and 74
												mm (weatherdb.com). Since rainfall during anthesis was the
												most significant term in determining yield, the manipulation
												of sowing time can be used to time echium growth with
												rainfall during anthesis, thereby increasing yield.
												Consequently, sowing echium in May, and assuming 45 days to
												first flower, synchronizes anthesis with higher summer
												rainfall and would be expected to achieve highest combined
												flower production and seed yield.</p>

												Echium yields for several experiments across North Dakota
												averaged 251 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												and were as high as 425 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Berti2">[10]</a>
												. Target sowing dates for these experiments were late May,
												and growing season durations ranged from 77 to 99 d, whereas
												durations for the current experiments ranged from 89 to 112
												d (
												<a href="#pone-0113556-t001">table 1</a>
												). In contrast, weedy echium growing in an ungrazed pasture
												in southern NSW produced over 30000 seed m
												<sup>â2</sup>
												and had a 100-seed weight of 0.38 g
												<a href="#pone.0113556-Piggin2">[19]</a>
												. These values convert to a seed yield of approximately 1100
												kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												. Plants in nearby grazed and mowed pastures produced about
												half of this amount (500 and 650 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												). These Australian seed production values included seeds
												retained on harvested plants as well as those in the litter
												and soil (2.5 cm depth). The average overall seed yield for
												the current experiments of 330 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												is much lower than that for southern Australia, but higher
												than that for North Dakota, and it was above the minimum
												production goal of 250 kg ha

												Corn and soybean are the two main crops in the Upper Midwest
												and Northern Great Plains. Median gross returns (N = 2553
												and 2209 farms) for these crops in 2012 were $2776 and $1628
												ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												, whereas net returns were $894 and $526 ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												according to the Farm Financial Database for Minnesota and
												the surrounding region (
												<a href="foo">http://www.finbin.umn.edu</a>
												). Net returns represented 32% of gross returns for both
												crops. To garner attention by growers, echium likely would
												have to match the net returns of corn or soybean. Assuming
												that the gross return to net return ratio is the same for
												echium as for corn and soybean, and that the contract price
												for echium seed is $5.30 kg
												<sup>â1</sup>
												<a href="#pone.0113556-NNFCC1">[9]</a>
												, then echium seed yields would need to be 310 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												to match the net return of soybean and 527 kg ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												to match corn in 2012. Corn and soybean prices in 2012 were
												uncommonly high, thus an echium seed yield of 250 to 300 kg
												ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												probably represents a reasonable minimum production goal for
												profitability and grower acceptance.

											<p>
												When sown in April or May in the Upper Midwest and Northern
												Great Plains, oilseed echium produces high seed yields whose
												value can rival those of standard commodity crops. With
												echium seed valued at $5.30 kg
												<sup>â1</sup>
												, early sown echium crops in 2011, 2012, and 2013 would have
												generated gross returns of $3710, $1733, and $2279 ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												, respectively. In 2010, 2011 and 2012 the average gross
												returns for corn were $2020, $2260 and $2776 ha
												<sup>â1</sup>
												(
												<a href="foo">http://finbin.umn.edu</a>
												), which overall makes echium a seemingly viable alternative
												crop from an economic perspective. In addition to its
												economic value, oilseed echium provides valuable ecosystem
												services (floral resources for pollinators) that cannot be
												matched by crops such as corn, soybean, and wheat. Early
												sown echium had high insect visitation and did not suffer
												the yield losses of late sown crops. From an agro-ecosystem
												perspective, early sown echium offers a high yielding crop
												to farmers and provides a valuable forage resource for
												pollinating insects.
